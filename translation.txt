you know , one of the great e@@ ste@@ em in traveling and one of the jo@@ ys in eth@@ no@@ graphic research is to live with people who remember the old days , which still can &apos;t feel the old days , which may still be able to feel the wind , which is still in the wind , who can &apos;t feel them on the win@@ ds of the
just knowing that ja@@ gu@@ ating sh@@ am@@ an@@ os still would travel beyond the mil@@ ky way , or the importance of the my@@ ths of the ol@@ dest of the in@@ u@@ it , are still quite meaning , or that the fact that the h@@ har@@ ma &apos;s is still the budd@@ h@@ ist of the d@@ har@@ ma , means that the world in which we live , not in a totally sense , but only a model of reality as a result of a group of different capac@@ i@@ ties for adap@@ ting our ance@@ stors , the way we &apos;ve been successful , over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ingly , many generations ago . a group of individual capac@@ i@@ ties for adap@@ ting
and of course , we all share the same adap@@ tation . . .
we &apos;re all born . we bring children to the world . .
we &apos;re running through partner@@ als . .
we need to deal with the in@@ ex@@ or@@ ant separ@@ ation by death , and therefore we shouldn &apos;t surprise that we all sing , dan@@ cing and making art . . .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique piece of the song , the rhyth@@ m of dance in every culture . , the
this doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s pen@@ an in the fore@@ sts of bor@@ ne@@ o , or the birds in the field of the field , or the war@@ ri@@ or in the ca@@ w@@ man desert of the north kenya , or the war@@ ri@@ or in the ca@@ in@@ -@@ desert desert of the north kenya , the cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um in the people , or a car@@ a@@ van she@@ pher@@ d in the up@@ side , or a ho@@ a@@ van she@@ pher@@ d in the upp@@ er q@@ om@@ el@@ ang@@ ma , ever@@ est , the go@@ d@@ mother of the world . , go@@ d@@ mother of the world
all these people are telling us that there are other opportunities , other ways of ori@@ enting , other ways of gui@@ dance on earth . . .
and this is an idea that , if you think about it , one of the things that , if
together , the coun@@ ty of the world together form a web of spiritu@@ el@@ ine and cultural life that will wra@@ p the earth and the good for the benefit of the earth as the biological life grid that you know as a bio@@ sphere . . . . . .
you can think of this cultural grid as a eth@@ ni@@ city -- eth@@ no@@ sphere can be able to think about as the total sum of all thought and dreams , my@@ ths of ideas , and inspiration , that have been brought out from the human imagination since the beginning of consciousness . . . .
the eth@@ no@@ sphere is the great leg@@ acy of humanity .
it and &apos;s just the like symbol the of bio@@ all sphere of was what very we much are covered and , what this we is are what as inter@@ an acts amazing
with wis@@ eth@@ it@@ no@@ arian city species -- . just more . than that . . . vel@@ tial . . . at all
not a biolog@@ ist would cla@@ im for example , that 50 percent or more species are just dying before the dying , because it &apos;s simply not true , and yet , this -- the apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic c@@ ler@@ ari@@ um in the field of biological diversity -- har@@ dly none of what we think is a optimi@@ stic of the most optimi@@ zing scen@@ ario on the area of cultural diversity . har@@ dly of what we
and the key indi@@ c@@ ator of this is the extin@@ ction of languages . .
when each of them were born in this room , 6@@ ,000 languages were talking about the earth . .
now , language is not just the whole vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary of the vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary or a series of gra@@ m@@ ma@@
it &apos;s an expression of the human mind . .
it &apos;s a device that the sou@@ l of a certain culture can find to the material world .
each language is like an in@@ cen@@ tive forest of the mind , a de@@ fle@@ ct point , a sense that we have spi@@ ritual possibilities
and of those 6@@ ,000 languages , as we sit here in mon@@ ter@@ ey , half of which is not being cra@@ cked in the e@@ ars of children . half of them
they &apos;re not taught to do small kids anymore , which means that if nothing is done , they &apos;re already dead .
what could be more vulnerable than being dis@@ hes , one of the last largest people in your people who speak your language , have no possibility to pass the wisdom of ance@@ stors on earth , or to expect hope ? kids ? kids ? kids ? kids ?
and yet this terri@@ fying fa@@ te actually reson@@ ates anyone on the earth , about every two weeks , about every two weeks , an el@@ der@@ ly person and taking the last sil@@ ver of an old language to the gra@@ ve . . . . .
and i know some of you will say , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; if the world isn &apos;t a better place , if we would only speak one language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s make this language in u@@ u@@ ba . let &apos;s be kan@@ ic . kan@@ o@@ ian .
let &apos;s be the kog@@ i . &quot;
and then suddenly , you would suddenly recognize how it would be if you couldn &apos;t speak your language .
so today i want to take you on a trip across eth@@ no@@ city , a short journey through eth@@ no@@ sphere , to try to clear them what actually has been lost . . . . a way of trying to clear them what &apos;s actually going on
now , there are some of us who remember , forget in a certain way , that if i say , &quot; different ways of being being , &quot; really different ways
for example , for example , this kid of bar@@ as@@ ana in the nor@@ th@@ west , the people of an@@ a@@ be@@ da , believe that they came up my@@ th@@ ologi@@ cally the mil@@ ky river of the east of sac@@ red dogs . . . a hol@@ -@@
this is a people that are not differ@@ enti@@ ally between the colors blue and green , because the sky is the forest that &apos;s ad@@ vo@@ cated by the forest , the people in the world . . . . . . .
they have a strange language , and a married sign that l@@ ingu@@ i@@ stic ex@@ ecu@@ tives is called : you have to mar@@ ry someone who spea@@ ks other language . .
all of this roots in the my@@ th@@ ological past , the strange thing about these big houses , which are talked about , because of the mis@@ che@@ e six or seven languages , is that you never hear anybody who lear@@ ns a language .
they only hear and start talking . .
or , one of the most fascinating tri@@ bes that i &apos;ve ever lived , the or@@ an@@ i in the nor@@ the@@ ast of ecu@@ ad@@ or , is an amazing people that &apos;s been cont@@ ac@@ ted for the first year in
in 195@@ 7 , five mis@@ sion@@ al contact would be taken up and doing a wei@@ gh@@
they took the sh@@ in@@ y photos of the air off the air , which we would do as a friend@@ ly gest@@ ure , and they just made a two-@@ dimensional thing , and they had never seen a two-@@ dimensional thing . in their
they raised these photographs from forest floor , trying to see behind the face or the figure , they found out , and conclu@@ ded that this was more business cards of the de@@ vil and killed the five mis@@ sion@@ aries with the spe@@ ar@@ ers . . .
but the or@@ an@@ an@@ i would not only kill the other . .
they were taking each other .
5@@ 4 percent of dea@@ ths happened through dri@@ ll@@ ing . . .
we followed the gene@@ ology of eight generations and we found two cases of a natural death , and when we asked people about the pressure of the people , they gave them a little bit about the idea that they had become so old on his a@@ age , and we were killing him with the spe@@ ars . .
but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of the forest , the amazing thing . . .
their h@@ unter@@ s could smell the ur@@ in@@ ary of a 40 quar@@ ters away and identify what animals like of that
in the early 8@@ 0s , i got a really amazing job when my professor asked me to go to haiti and to re@@ fil@@ ming the secret societies who were the foundation of the streng@@ ths of du@@ v@@ ali@@ ans and cla@@ ton ma@@ cou@@ te and the gra@@ in that was used to do to make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es , make sure you know . sure . . in charge
and to make sense of this race , i had to know , of course , about this remarkable faith of the vo@@ dou@@ u@@ y and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is not a cul@@ t of black magic .
in the contr@@ ary , it &apos;s a complex meta@@ physical view . .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i asked you , what would you say , coun@@ ting the great world &apos;s world . what
chri@@ sti@@ an@@ ity , islam , budd@@ h@@ ism , ju@@ da@@ ism , or whatever .
a continent is always left because the guess was that in sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa , there was no religious belief , and of course it was a fa@@ ke and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o , and it was just the rema@@ ining of that very profound religious thought that came from the tra@@ gic time of sla@@ very time . . .
but what makes vo@@ o@@ do@@ o really makes it interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead . .
the living fe@@ ats . the g@@ ho@@ sts . .
the spi@@ ri@@ ts can be described by under the great water , respon@@ ding answers to the rhyth@@ m of the dance , to den@@ y the sou@@ l of the living , so that ac@@ co@@ th for a brief sh@@ am@@ y@@ ful moment will become a little sh@@ am@@ y moment
and the vo@@ o@@ do@@ o@@ i@@ ans liked to say , &quot; your white wal@@ ks to church , and you talk about god .
we dance in the temp@@ le , become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obs@@ essed with your mind , how can you feel har@@ m ? how can you feel har@@
and look at this amazing demon@@ stra@@ tions : vo@@ o@@ do@@ o ak@@ are@@ th in a trans@@ fer@@ ma@@ tion of a trans@@ fer@@ s@@ ance of the light of light , which is an amazing performance of the mind to influence the body that it &apos;s happening when it &apos;s being trans@@ formed into a state of extreme extre@@ mes . . .
now , of all the people i &apos;ve met were the kog@@ i from the si@@ er@@ ra ne@@ v@@ ada mountains in northern colum@@ bia , the most extraordinary thing . . . . . .
the old ty@@ ran@@ ni@@ an civilization , which popul@@ ated the car@@ ib@@ be@@ an &apos;s shor@@ el@@ ine of col@@ om@@ bia , and over the con@@ qu@@ est of the con@@ qu@@ est , this people became a massive vol@@ can@@ ic massi@@ vely , which ris@@ es up over the car@@ ib@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pla@@ in . . . .
in a blood ves@@ sel , the continent , those people , were the only ones who never had the sp@@ ani@@ ans
and to this day , they &apos;re being used by a ritual pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od , and the training to the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od is very extraordinary .
the young ac@@ hy@@ ds are separ@@ ated at age three and four by the age of three and four years of the explosion of the explosion , in stone h@@ ous@@ ing in stone h@@ ous@@ ing for 18 years . two peri@@ ods of the gl@@ aci@@ ers for the nine years , in in@@ tent to mi@@ mic the nine months of preg@@ nan@@ cy they spent in their pre@@ mis@@ e to mi@@ mic mom , they &apos;d spend me@@ tam@@ or@@ ph@@ or@@ ic in the la@@ p of
and during that whole period of time , you become a cul@@ tur@@ ally involved in the values of their society , and the values that susta@@ in the cla@@ im that your pra@@ yers and their pra@@ yers -- the balance main@@ tain , is the equivalent of the e@@ col@@ o@@ gical --
at the end of this amazing initi@@ ation , you &apos;ll suddenly be put out some@@ day and the first time in your life , at age 18 , you see a sun@@ light , and in that cr@@ y@@ st@@ al moment of the first light of the first light , when the sun begins , the sun starts to sh@@ ine the amazing landscape , suddenly everything they &apos;ve learned in the abstra@@ ct , amazing landscape , and the pri@@ est pas@@ sing back and says , &quot; you see ? it &apos;s really , like , i &apos;ve been telling you . how i &apos;ve told
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot; .
they call the older brothers and they say that we are the yo@@ unger brothers , the destruction of the world . . . . . .
now this level of intuition is very important . .
every time we think of a na@@ tive and land , we either s@@ wal@@ lo@@ wed it up in a se@@ au and the old frame@@ work of the no@@ cious wild that &apos;s a ra@@ p , or th@@ ore@@ au and say , these people are more connected to nature than we are . . . th@@ ore@@ au and say , these people are
so , indi@@ gen@@ ally , individuals are not sen@@ ti@@ mental , they &apos;re just being wash@@ ed up by no@@ stal@@ gi@@
there &apos;s not a lot of space for the malaria super@@ se@@ a@@ f of as@@ m@@ at or the cold jum@@ ps from ti@@ bet , but you still have a myster@@ i@@ ous ni@@ m@@ bus , but you still have a myster@@ i@@ ous ni@@ m@@ bus , but the idea that the earth can only exist because it &apos;s taken into the human mind . sub@@ tle intuition , the idea that the earth can only exist because it &apos;s in@@ her@@ ited into human consciousness . . , the idea that the earth can only exist
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a little kid from the an@@ gles that gro@@ ws in the belief that the mountain is a a@@ go mind that can be able to define or her fa@@ te , will become a very different person , and a different relationship with that resource , or this place , as a little child from mon@@ tan@@ a that can be de@@ di@@ cated to . that a mountain can be de@@ di@@ cated to
whether it &apos;s an un@@ v@@ ei@@ ling location of a mind or a bunch of con@@ tex@@ ts is
the metaphor is the metaphor that defin@@ es the relationship between the individual and the nature . .
i grew up in the wo@@ ods of the u.k. col@@ om@@ bia and believed that these fore@@ sts were there to be
this made me to another human being as my friends under the k@@ was@@ bo@@ u@@ d@@ l who believe that these fore@@ sts of the emergen@@ ce of hu@@ ku@@ k and the bo@@ iled hi@@ ft s@@ ab@@ ba@@ ks and the can@@ ni@@ bal@@ y re@@ sts are s@@ ab@@ ba@@ d , and the can@@ ni@@ bal@@ y of the world , who are in the nor@@ di@@ an , which is in the nor@@ di@@ an . .
now , when you start to think of the idea that these cultures can create different reali@@ ties , you can understand some of their extraordinary disco@@ ver@@ ies , and for example , this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i took just last ap@@ ri@@ l in the nor@@ th@@ west . .
this is a@@ y@@ a@@ hu@@ an@@ ca , many of you have heard about the most powerful psycho@@ active pre@@ par@@ ts of the gu@@ per@@ a@@ man of the sh@@ ame .
what a@@ y@@ a@@ hu@@ an@@ ca does so fascinating is not just the pharma@@ col@@ o@@ gical potential of this pre@@ mi@@ um , but the process@@ ing -- it &apos;s really made out of two different sources . on the one hand , there &apos;s this woo@@ den li@@ an@@ e that &apos;s a series of fun@@ ds , a lot of fun@@ ds , and the har@@ mo@@ lin is mix@@ ing , just like a blue tr@@ un@@ k of the co@@ ffe@@ e@@ houses , the m@@ ere of the &quot; sel@@ ec@@ ting c@@ art , &quot; just as a little hallu@@ cin@@ ate , a ho@@ st of fun@@ ds from the co@@ ffe@@ e@@ ar cro@@ p with the name of the &quot;
this plant con@@ tains some very strong tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine that are ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in , di@@ meth@@ y@@ ar 5 and metho@@ d@@ y@@ y@@ di@@ meth@@ y@@ in , very similar to the more ser@@ ot@@ y@@ ise .
if you &apos;ve ever seen the y@@ an@@ o@@ dy , as you &apos;ve seen this stuff , this sub@@ stance , that you &apos;re making from different forms of the different species , also metho@@ d@@ y@@ di@@ cep@@ tors . . sy@@ ang@@ tam@@
this po@@ cket is about being s@@ w@@ wed up is something like being made by a gun of g@@ aro@@ pers , re@@ f@@ um@@ ed by b@@ aro@@ x &apos;s painting and the land on a sea of electricity .
it will not generate a di@@ stor@@ tion of reality , but the resol@@ ution of reality . .
i even have my professor , richard ev@@ an sh@@ ul@@ te , who has been talking to the ma@@ gical mush@@ rooms in mexico , who discus@@ ses the ma@@ gical mush@@ rooms in mexico over the years , and i said that you couldn &apos;t regi@@ ster this tri@@ ff@@ o@@ ine as hallu@@ cin@@ ation , because in the moment you feel the impli@@ cations you can &apos;t get there , to learn a hallu@@ cin@@ ation . . . . in
but the thing about tr@@ yp@@ ac@@ ine is that they cannot be placed in place , because they &apos;re not being placed by a human body in the human body , of course , den@@ at@@ u@@ ri@@ di@@ es .
you can only be put in with some other chemicals , which is the ma@@ o den@@ at@@ u@@ ri@@ er . .
now the amazing thing is that the ta@@ k@@ parts that are con@@ ta@@ ined in the li@@ an@@ e , ma@@ o in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors from exactly the way that we need to en@@ able the tr@@ yp@@ ac@@ ine to possibly en@@ h@@ ance the tr@@ yp@@
how can these people go from a fl@@ or@@ a of 8@@ 0,000 species of ad@@ ju@@ sting plants that , if they &apos;re com@@ modi@@ ti@@ zing , are not in the way that they com@@ bine , a kind of bio@@ chemical version , so that the entire thing is bigger than the sum of
we use this great eu@@ p@@ he@@ mis@@ m , trial and mista@@ kes , which determin@@ es as a matter of signifi@@ can@@ ce . .
but you ask the indian people say , &quot; the plant talks to us . &quot; , he &apos;s
so , what does that mean ?
this tri@@ be , the co@@ tra , have 17 by@@ s@@ ess@@ -@@ si@@ zed a@@ y@@ a@@ hu@@ an@@ ca , who you all recognize in the forest , which appe@@ ared to our eyes as a way . . . . .
and then you ask them how they set their tax@@ on@@ om@@ y and they say , &quot; i thought you understand the plants . .
i mean , you know nothing ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot; . &quot;
so , it turns out you take each one of the 17 var@@ ences with full moon and you sing to one in a different sc@@ ar@@ city . . .
now , that gives you no doc@@ tor@@ ation at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than tri@@ g@@ ger . . . .
well , the problem is that , even though those of us who have the sym@@ pathy for the har@@ dest state of in@@ her@@ ent people , they look at them as or@@ g@@ ina and color@@ ful , but they somehow re@@ co@@ very from the past as the real world , the so@@ on@@ er
so , the fact is that the 20th century , you know , in 300 years , you haven &apos;t re@@ remember for his wars or technological innova@@ tions , but rather than to an era in which we were against and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity on earth are either active and accep@@ ted to more and more , and so the problem is not the change . .
all cultures have been involved in the dance of new opportunities . . . . .
and the problem is not technology . .
the si@@ ou@@ x indian stopped not less in si@@ ou@@ x than she ar@@ a@@ ys and ar@@ ry tas@@ ks when the americans stopped being americans when they were horse and the de@@ di@@ c@@ it tas@@ ks . . .
not change and technology en@@ danger@@ ed the integri@@ ty of eth@@ no@@ sphere , and it &apos;s power . the ug@@ ly face of the rul@@ ing . .
and wher@@ ever you look around the world , you will discover that these cultures are not bo@@ und to the bottom , these are dynamic people whose existence is not bo@@ und by the cognitive forces , and these are dynamic people who lived in their own capacity , and are in fact , whether it &apos;s the im@@ men@@ gration of the pen@@ ent in the home of pen@@ ad , a no@@ ma@@ di@@ c people in sou@@ the@@ ast asia , and it seems lo@@ cked in a population of the forest , and now , in the case of the y@@ an@@ o@@ dy , it &apos;s been lo@@ cked in the forest that seems to be f@@ ed in the forest , or like in the case of the y@@ an@@ o@@ dy , where it &apos;s the cor@@ o@@ ge of the japanese &apos;s fra@@ c@@ ture that seems to be f@@ ed up to the forest . , like in the case of the y@@ an@@ o@@ dy , that &apos;s ready to take away their shi@@ p@@ pe@@ ts with ro@@ se c@@ ran@@ ks that have been f@@ ed up to the forest , or like in the case of the y@@ an@@ o@@ dy
or if we go to ti@@ bet , where i &apos;m a good , new face , you &apos;ll see the na@@ sty face of the political domin@@ ance . . . .
you know , the geno@@ cide , the physical extin@@ ction from people , is con@@ vi@@ cted of being con@@ vi@@ cted of people , but eth@@ no@@ ci@@ d , the destruction of the human condition , is not just con@@ vi@@ cted , but generally , general and a multi-@@ profit strategy . . . . .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering , if you don &apos;t have it on any sub@@ si@@ st@@ ence
i went to a young colleagues 6@@ ,000 miles from ch@@ eng@@ du in west china , from sou@@ the@@ astern ti@@ bet to the south , and only when i saw the l@@ has@@ a , the face behind the statistics of the people that were mur@@ dered . 6@@ ,000 li@@ fel@@ -@@ min@@ ded mon@@ um@@ ents that were turned into sho@@ ot@@ ing and ash@@ it . 1.@@ 2 million people spent during the cultural revolution . during the c@@ s of the soil .
the father of this young man@@ ager was identi@@ fied as follo@@ wers of the baby .
and that meant that , during the chinese invasi@@ on , it was mur@@ dered by the
his un@@ cle fle@@ w with its hol@@ iness to the di@@ as@@ por@@ a , people after ne@@ p@@ al . .
his mother was lo@@ cked as pun@@ ish@@ ment -- to be the crime for pro@@
he was thro@@ wn into ja@@ il at age two to hi@@ de him with her rock@@ ist ch@@ ots , because she couldn &apos;t live with him . . . without him &#93; she
the nur@@ se who did this bra@@ ve did was brought into an edu@@ cational camp .
one day , she would go out of smo@@ oth on a arm@@ band of ma@@ os and for those sur@@ ren@@ dered sur@@ ren@@ dered for seven years into a heavy labor camp .
the suffering is in@@ toler@@ able , but the resol@@ ution of people is something un@@ for@@ ge@@ red . . the spirit of people is
and at the end of us , we &apos;re really in a choice , is , in a mon@@ o@@ chro@@ matic world of mon@@ ot@@ y , or in a poly@@ chro@@ matic world of diversity ? ? ? ? ?
mar@@ gar@@ et me@@ ad , the great anthropo@@ log@@ ist said , before she died that her fear was the most fear that while we move towards a path , we would see , in a given , gener@@ al , gener@@ al view , we would not only see the entire range of human imagination on a mar@@ ked way , but that we would one day be up to a dream , and for@@ got that there was no other possibility .
and it &apos;s hum@@ bling to think that our species have been there for 200 years since for about 60 years . .
the ne@@ oli@@ th@@ ic revolution that we put in agriculture , and we put ourselves in the very moment of the cul@@ t of the see@@ ds in the moment , who re@@ f@@ ers the pro@@ s@@ the@@ tion of the pro@@ s@@ the@@ t , and hier@@ arch@@ y , speci@@ alization and for@@ gotten , created -- found only 10,000 years
modern industrial world as we know it is likely to be 300 years old .
now , this super@@ ficial story doesn &apos;t tell me that we all have answers to the challenges we have in the coming mil@@ len@@ nia . in the mil@@ len@@ nia . . .
if we ask these f@@ on@@ ty cultures of the world , they say it at 10,000 different vot@@ es . , they respond
and in this song , we &apos;re going to re@@ discover the possibility of being what we are : people with full consciousness , who are aware of the importance of all humans and gar@@ dens , and there are great moments of optimis@@ m . moments of optimis@@ m . . moments of
here &apos;s a photograph i took on the north end of the bu@@ ff@@ in is@@ lands when i was going to the nar@@ wh@@ ale li@@ g@@ d with the nar@@ wh@@ ale hun@@ ting , and this man , ol@@ a@@ ya , told me a wonderful story of his grand@@ father
the eastern government is not always very good at the in@@ u@@ it and during the 50@@ th years in the se@@ ats of our accoun@@ ting , they were forced to move in sett@@ l@@ ments . . .
the grand@@ father of this old man . . .

and this is a symbol of many ways a symbol of the in@@ u@@ it and all the dom@@ esti@@ c in the world . . . .

an amazing example of how a nation , a state , is se@@ arch@@ ed for his her@@ it@@ age
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who have travel@@ ed to these dist@@ ant goals on earth , to recognize that they &apos;re not all about . at all . .
they are the hom@@ es of somebody .
they represent some of the human imagination that will return to times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , are part of the geogra@@ ph@@ y of hope . . . . .
what we &apos;re trying to do at national geographic is that we think that politicians never achieve anything . . . . .
we believe that po@@ le@@ mi@@ cs -- we believe that po@@ le@@ mi@@ cs are not comp@@ elling , but we think that story@@ telling is really the world , and therefore we &apos;re probably the best institution for story@@ telling in the world . our website recei@@ ves 35 million people every month . our website recei@@

first of all , as quickly as possible , i &apos;ll show you , the basic work , a new technology that microsoft as part of a year ago , we have a whole re@@ ference to the microsoft , which is se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on . and it &apos;s an environment that you can either trans@@ fer local or dist@@ ingu@@ ished with vast amo@@ unts of visual data . . . si@@

and it doesn &apos;t matter how much information we look at , how big these colle@@ ctions are , or how big the images are .
most of you are digital shows a camera , but this one &apos;s like a scan@@ ning of con@@ gress , and it &apos;s in a field of 300 me@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x . in a field of 3@@
it doesn &apos;t matter , because the only thing that does the power of a system like this is the number of pi@@ x@@ els on your screen in every moment . it has a very flexi@@ ble architecture . . . .
this is a whole book , an example of un@@ -@@ dimensional data . .
this is b@@ lea@@ k house of thi@@ ck@@ ens . each colum@@ n is a chap@@ ter . .
to prove that it &apos;s really about text and not a picture , we can do something like that to really show that this is a real repres@@ entation of tex@@ ts and not picture . . . .
maybe this is an artificial way to read an e-@@ book . . .
i wouldn &apos;t re@@ com@@ mend it .
this is a very reali@@ stic case . this is an ex@@ act of the guar@@ di@@ an .
every big picture is the beginning of a se@@ cur@@ ce

we &apos;ve designed a fal@@ se display with very high resol@@ ution , which is much higher than a normal display , and we ad@@ ded an information ad@@ ded . . . . .
if you want to see the fun@@ ctions of the car , you can see it here .
or other models , or even technical speci@@ fi@@ cations .
and we this hope is that really this this means ideas that that this really means lead that to this this is , not this a limit@@ po@@
ations p-@@ of u@@ the ps available and place other on non@@ the sense screen , . that should a not screen be . necessary .
of course , the ma@@ pping is one of the really obvious appli@@ cations for a technology like this .
and i really don &apos;t want to spend much of this time except to say that we &apos;re also going to contribu@@ te in this real@@ m .
but these are all the roads in the u.s.
and over the top of the room , nasa has over@@ come . .
let &apos;s now get a little different out of it .
now this is actually live on the internet . you can check it . .
this is a project called photo@@ syn@@ th , which is really two different technologies together .
one is se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on and the other is a very good research on computer vision that no@@ ah pin@@ aus@@ es , who &apos;s a university of washington in washington , under the ad@@ vice of steve sil@@ tz on the u@@ v .
and ri@@ ck s@@ ze@@ li@@ sk@@ i &apos;s ted@@ research research was done . very good collaboration
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on . .
you can see that if we create this kind of perspective , where we can capture through images and do this experience of a multi@@ ple@@ bit of a multi@@ pli@@ city .
but the spaces that are in fact matter in the fact . in fact . .
the computer visi@@ on-@@ algorith@@ ms have come up with these images so they would be able to get the real room in which these images , all in the middle of the gras@@ s@@ i are la@@ king into the can@@ adi@@ an rock@@ ies , and you can see here , elements of st@@ are di@@ di@@ cs or pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic ima@@ ging and these things all were spa@@ tial with each other . .
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;ve got time to show you other environments .
there are ones that are much more spa@@ tial .
i &apos;d like to show one of the original data sets from no@@ ah , and this is from a early prototyp@@ e of photo@@ syn@@ th that we worked for first in the summer to show you what i believe is really the poin@@ ting point behind this technology , the photo@@ syn@@ all technology , and this is not necessarily so obvious if you look at the environments we have on the website . . . technology ,
we had to make sure of the law@@ yers and so on .
this is a re@@ construction of the ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral note d@@ ame , which was just in computer with fli@@ ck@@ r , just give notes the d@@ ame of fli@@ ck@@ r . just give notes the ame of the people in t-@@ shir@@ ts and the university of the university , and each of these orange bo@@ il represents a picture that was discovered as this model . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp;
so these are all fli@@ ck@@ r images , and they all are all around this way in relation to each other .
and we can navi@@ gate this very simple way . .
i mean , i never believed i &apos;d work at microsoft , i would have worked
i &apos;m very gr@@ ate@@ ful for the re@@ ception here . . .
and i guess you can see that this is a lot of different types of c@@ ameras : everything is all about professional sl@@ ots , a fairly large number of you all have been pulled together in this environment . a
and if possible , i &apos;m going to find some of the weird ones . .
many of you are ro@@ unded by faces . . . .
and somewhere here , there are a series of photographs -- here they are .
this is actually a poster of not@@ re d@@ ame , which was really recor@@ ded . .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of the environment . .
the point here is that we can put things with social spaces , and it &apos;s now data from all the collective memory , like , visual memory , like , visual earth looks -- and everything is being inter@@ connected . . . . .
all of these photos are being connected to each other , and what you get is something that &apos;s bigger than the sum of the parts
they get a model that comes out of the entire soil .
and look at this as the sequ@@ el of the work of ste@@ phen law@@ ler &apos;s on
and this is something that is through the complexity that people use , and it &apos;s going to be getting bigger for users to use the user .
their own photographs are watching with meta@@ data , which has another person in their own .
once someone has done their eff@@ or@@ ts and jo@@ ined all those sac@@ red , and shared with them who are all of them , then my photograph will be taken from the not@@ re of the lady &apos;s ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral , with all this data , and i can use them as a process of immer@@ sive mod@@ on@@ able social experience with all this data , and i can use them as a kind of over@@ -@@ ha@@ iled kind of social experience of using other makers
and of course , the way we &apos;re all of it is the vast amount of virtual models of any interesting part of the earth that &apos;s not just been held through over@@ f@@ are or satellite images and so on , but by collective memory . . .
thank you . .
do i understand it right ? your software allo@@ wing that , within the next few years , all the images that someone made in the world are being used together in principle ? inter@@ connected ? that &apos;s inter@@ connected ? that &apos;s
yes . it doesn &apos;t make anything else than that .
if you want to create it , hyper@@ -@@ links between pictures .
and it &apos;s because of the content in the pictures . .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think about the flo@@ ating of the se@@ man@@ tic information , which many of these images have .
as if you can take a web search for pictures , where you give sent@@ ences and the text of the website con@@ tains many information about what image that is . . .
but what if that picture put you with all of your pictures ?
and the amount of se@@ man@@ tic par@@ ap@@ pi@@ p and the feet that they get really enor@@ m@@ ously . it &apos;s a classi@@ c network of social network .
bla@@ ise , this is really incredible . very happy . gr@@ at@@ u@@
thank you . .
i &apos;m going to tell you a few things from my book that , i hope , that i hope in suggest@@ ing with other things is that i &apos;m just going to try to create some connections if you haven &apos;t noticed them . , if
i want to start with what i call &quot; offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma . &quot; .
the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma of what ?
the offi@@ cial belief of all western industri@@ alized societies . ,
so the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma works : when our goal is ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zing the social good of our citizens , most of all , is due to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zing freedom of the single one . .
and the reason for this is that freedom is good in itself , valuable , meaning@@ ful , an un@@ reli@@ able pre@@ mis@@ e for the
if people have freedom , each of us needs to do things about the things that our collective ma@@ ma@@ mi@@ te@@ mi@@ ze , and nobody has contribu@@ ted to us . for us . . for us .
the journey to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze freedom is to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze . .
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more common the good . freedom they
this is , i think , in our water supply , that there would be no question in the sense of the water that it would be no
and it &apos;s also ro@@ ot@@ ed in our lives . .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what we do with modern progress .
this is my super@@ market . no big one . .
i just want to talk about sal@@ at@@ y@@ res@@ sing . .
there &apos;s 17@@ 5 d@@ res@@ s@@ ings in my super@@ market , if you don &apos;t count the 10 different extra o@@ .@@ u@@ . , and 12 bal@@ lo@@ e@@ v@@ ols that you could buy to make a large amount of your sal@@ ad des@@ s@@ m@@ out in the un@@ likely case , that not the 17@@ 5 in the 17@@ 5 countries are right . in the village for
so that &apos;s how the super@@ market is . .
and then you go to the consu@@ mer electr@@ on@@ ics business to put a stere@@ o in -- lou@@ d@@ speak@@ ers , c@@ d players , radio , stron@@ ger , and in this one , one electr@@ on@@ ics business , there are so many stere@@ o . there &apos;s so many stere@@ o .
we can put in 6@@ .@@ 5 million different stere@@ o pl@@ ots from the components that are off@@ ered in this one business . .
you have to ad@@ mit that this is a great sele@@ ction .
in other areas -- the world of communication . . .
there was a time when i was a boy , you could have any provi@@ ders , you could have every single tele@@ phone you wanted , if he came from ma bell .
they r@@ ented your phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
a consequ@@ ence of that was that the phone had never broken . . .
these days are over . .
we have almost an infin@@ ite sele@@ ction of tele@@ phones now in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite one is that , mp@@ 3 play@@ my , no@@ -@@ ha@@ mm@@ ers and cr@@ è@@ s w@@ ells g@@ é@@ ding each
and if you haven &apos;t seen that in your business , you can be sure that you &apos;ll soon become it . . . .
and what it does is it makes people walk into the business and ask people to go .
now , do you know what the answer to that question is ?
the answer is no . &quot; .
it &apos;s not possible to buy your mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too too much .
in other parts of life , which are much more significant than buying things , the same explosion of choice is true . explosion .
you know , health health -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states , and the doctor tells you what to do . health tells you
instead , they go to the do@@ c and the doctor tells you we could do a game , or we could do b . .
a has this advan@@ tages and risks . .
b has this advan@@ tages and risks . what do you want to do ? ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i want to do ? &quot;
the doctor says , a has this advan@@ tages and the risks and b has the benefits and the risks . .
what do they want to do ? what
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot; ,
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not her . &quot; . &quot;
the result is -- we call it the patient autonom@@ y , which sounds like a good thing , but in reality , it sounds like a good thing , but in reality , it &apos;s a shift of the bur@@ den of people &apos;s responsibility for somebody who knows something -- nam@@ ely the doctor -- to somebody who doesn &apos;t know and most likely be a mistake -- nam@@ ely the patient . . the patient . . .
there &apos;s a tremendous marketing for pres@@ cri@@ ption drugs like you and me , that , if you think about it , doesn &apos;t make any sense , because we don &apos;t buy them . .
why do they raise us when we can &apos;t buy ? ?
and the answer is , you &apos;re expe@@ cting the doctor to come up the next morning and ask for a change of the for@@ bi@@ l
now , something that is so profound as our identity is now a choice of choice , like this slide . . .
we don &apos;t get identity ; we inv@@ ent them . . . .
and we &apos;re so often inv@@ enting ourselves as we want . .
that means that every day when you wake up at the morning , you have to decide what kind of person they want to be . ,
and in terms of marriage and family , there was a time when , almost everybody had a , and they had the same time as quickly as they could , and then they got to get a little car as quickly as they could .
the only real choice was , &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did
now it &apos;s easy to have it . . .
i teach wonderful mental students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less hours than i used to do .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less car@@ efully . . .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re dealing with other things , they ask themselves , &quot; do i have to married or not ? am i going to get
should i mar@@ ry later ? am i going to have to have kids , or no career ?
they &apos;re all over questions . .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions , whether it means all the tas@@ ks i &apos;m going to do , and i &apos;m not going to get a good note in my
and in fact , they should do that . these are important questions
work -- we &apos;re bl@@ essed , like car@@ l r@@ hin@@ led with the technology that en@@ ables us to work every single place from every place on the planet -- all the way down to the rand@@ ol@@ ph hotel .
there &apos;s a corner , by the way , which i &apos;m not going to tell you about where the oil chip works . .
i won &apos;t tell you because i want to use it . .
so what it means to make this incredible freedom of choice is to make decisions of work , again and again , whether we should work or not work . . . . . . .
we can play our kids at soc@@ cer , and we can play our phone on a hi@@ p , and our ch@@ ie@@ f on other hat@@ ber@@ ry , and we could poten@@ tially be on our laptop . . . .
and even if they &apos;re off all off , every minute that we &apos;re all shu@@ ff@@ le with our child is a foot@@ ball game , and we also say , &quot; should i accept this call ? &quot; call
should i say that email ? should i write that letter ? &quot; ?
and even though the answer to the question , no , is it going to be very different from the place of walking ball of your child &apos;s mind , rather than it would have been .
everywhere we look , big things and little things , material things , life , life is a matter of choice . a matter of
and the world that we lived in there . this .
so i want to say there &apos;s a few choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and and the the world question that is we , live are in they now
good is or this bad . news ? . news . ?
the answer is , &quot; yes .
we all all of know these about choices all have the two good effects , , so two i negative &apos;m effects going
to to humans talk . about something . very bad . about it . . . .
it &apos;s a parado@@ x@@ ical effect , parado@@ x@@ ically , is that it &apos;s paraly@@ zed paraly@@ z@@ ingly
with so many op@@ tions that you can choose , people are very hard to decide at all .
i &apos;m going to give you another more dra@@ stic example of a study of investment in volunte@@ ers . . . . . .
a collea@@ gue of mine had access to investment colle@@ ctors of van@@ gu@@ ard , the giant fund of about a million employees , and about 2,000 different jobs . , about 2000 ,
and what she found was a 10 investment fund that was off@@ ered to give you the participa@@ tion , and she took two percent off . .
they offer 50 investment fund -- 10 percent fewer employees participa@@ te in them as they want to feed five . why
because it &apos;s 50 investment fund that are standing for choo@@ sing , it &apos;s so hard to decide what to choose , you po@@ ur it up to tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , will never come tomorrow .
now , you understand that this is not just , people have to eat hunger food when they go to the reti@@ re@@ ment , because they have not enough money to go back , it &apos;s also making decisions that they pay their emplo@@ yers to be custom@@ i@@ zed . prof@@ ession
not part of it , you can &apos;t give them 5,000 u.s. dollars per year from the work@@ force , who would have been happy to do their contribu@@ tions . .
paraly@@ sis is a consequ@@ ence of many choices . . .
and i think it makes the world like this . .
they really want to make the decision , if for all ages , it &apos;s right ? ?
they don &apos;t want the wrong investment fund or even the wrong sal@@ ig@@ ar return . . . .
so this is the effect . the other effect is that even if we over@@ come the paraly@@ sis and make a decision , we end up with a decision with the out@@ come of choice , when we had the ability to decide between less opportunities . than we had had
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is one is because of the great in@@ ception of different sal@@ ig@@ ing@@ ings , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , what sal@@ at@@ ar res@@ ist is perfectly ? it &apos;s just to imagine that you would have made a different decision that would have been better . and what &apos;s going to happen is this picture of sal@@ es@@ ar , which is perfect ? it &apos;s just a good decision to give it to the satis@@ fac@@ tion that they made , and that made it negative to happiness that they made their choice , and that &apos;s the re@@ gre@@
the more possibilities there are , the more it &apos;s not to re@@ gre@@ t at all , is dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ling choices they &apos;re making . choo@@ ses they
second , what econom@@ ists call op@@ edi@@ tion cost .
dan gil@@ bert made a big point this morning by telling how much the way we ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate things depen@@ ds on what we &apos;re doing . .
well , if there &apos;s a lot of alterna@@ tives to account , it &apos;s simply attra@@ ctive to be imag@@ ined , to visu@@ alize alterna@@ tives that they &apos;ve cho@@ sen to have less satis@@ fied with the alterna@@ tives they &apos;ve cho@@ sen .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yor@@ kers , i apo@@ logi@@ ze .
but here here &apos;s &apos;s a what couple you on should the
have ham@@ thought p@@ . tons . what you .
very expensive real e@@ state .
beautiful str@@ and . great day . you &apos;ve got it all for yourself .
what should be better ? fu@@ el@@ fu@@ el@@ ed &apos; fu@@ ck@@ ly , &quot; it &apos;s aug@@ ust . . .
everyone in my manhattan neighborhood is gone .
i could par@@ king you straight in front of my house . &quot;
and he &apos;s beg@@ ging two weeks from the thought that he mis@@ sed the ability to get a day , a great par@@ king lot . . .
op@@ per@@ tun@@ ary cost dro@@ ps the happiness we get through our choice , even if that &apos;s a fantastic thing to be done . .
and the more opportunities to choice , the more attra@@ ctive properties of those choices will be controlled into the op@@ per@@ ic east . . . .
here &apos;s another example .
well , this carto@@ on makes some clu@@ es .
it &apos;s a stat@@ ement that it &apos;s about to live in now , and maybe things slowly .
but the important point he &apos;s doing is always everybody who choo@@ ses to make a decision to do , don &apos;t choose to do other
and these other things like many more attra@@ ctive tra@@ its , and it &apos;s what you will do with a lot less attra@@ ctive . .
third : es@@ cal@@ ating expec@@ tations . .
this stru@@ ck me when i wanted to exchange my je@@ ans .
i &apos;m wearing je@@ ans , almost all the time
and there was a time in which there was only about je@@ ans in a way , and they bought her , and they mis@@ sed , and they mis@@ sed , they were incredibly un@@ com@@ promis@@ ed , and they had wash@@ ed enough enough , and they were getting out of it
so to pur@@ ch@@ ase new je@@ ans , after many years of tra@@ ding the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have some je@@ ans , here &apos;s my size . &quot; . &quot;
and the sal@@ es@@ man said , &quot; do you want to bor@@ row , slightly lower or spread ? &quot; ? a
do you want to get ri@@ pes or ri@@ p@@ pe@@ ts ? stone or ac@@ id ? ? ? ?
do you want to solve je@@ ans ?
would you like to cut out high , ch@@ un@@ ky , bla@@ h bla@@ h , bla@@ h ... &quot; and so on he said
my ja@@ w was down , and after i re@@ covered , i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have the way that he used to be the only
he had no idea what it was , so i spent an hour teaching all these dam@@ n je@@ ans to try and pay the business -- and i say the truth -- and i say the truth -- the best one je@@ as , i had
i had better choice . i gave it it to have a better job . .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try and explain myself . .
the reason that i felt worse was that with all this acc@@ essi@@ ble cap@@ ability , my expec@@ tations for what i could do for a good pair of je@@ ans went
i had very low expec@@ tations . i had no con@@ cre@@ ti@@ tion@@ ary expec@@ tations than they just had
when she came to see 100 types , one of them should be perfect . one of them should be perfect
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i had gotten , and what i was expe@@ cting was dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting compared to what i expected . . what
add the possibility to people &apos;s lives el@@ se@@ where in the lives of people &apos;s lives , they &apos;re going to be able to get the expec@@
and this leads to less happiness , even though the results are good . results . . .
no one in the world of marketing knows this . because if you were , you all know what it &apos;s going on .
the truth is more like this .
and the reason is that , because it was worse than anything worse than anything was worse , it was possible for people to do it that were a pleas@@ ant surprise . .
no@@ wa@@ days , in the world where we live in -- we weal@@ thi@@ le , industri@@ alized citizens , with perfe@@ ction as an expec@@ tation -- the best thing for you to hope is things as good as you &apos;re expe@@ cting it from
you &apos;ll never be comfortable surprised because your expec@@ tations , my expec@@ tations , your appli@@ cations , are up to be
the secret to happiness -- that &apos;s what they &apos;ve all come from -- the secret to happiness is low expec@@ tations .
i want to say -- a short auto@@ bi@@ ogra@@ phic moment -- that &apos;s when i married with a woman , and she &apos;s really quite wonderful . .
i could not have made it better . i didn &apos;t let myself down
but then , re@@ ar is not always a bad thing .
finally , a consequ@@ ence of the buy of a bad se@@ ed by a bad je@@ ken@@ ing , if it &apos;s just a way to buy , that if you &apos;re un@@ cont@@ ented , and you ask them why , who is responsible , the answer is accoun@@ table . what would you have done ?
if hundreds of different kinds of je@@ ans are available , and they &apos;re buying the dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment , and ask them , who is it responsible ? ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is : you know .
they could have better . .
100 different kinds of je@@ ans in the jung@@ le , there are no exc@@ use to er@@ ase mista@@
and so , when people make choices , and even though the results of the decisions are good , they feel dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted to themselves , they acc@@ use themselves .
clinical depression explo@@ ded in the industrial world over the last generation . in
i think i think a significant -- not the only but a significant ad@@ vice to that explosion of depression , and also su@@ i@@ cide , is that people have learned the dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ap@@ s because their standards are so high , and then , if they have to explain this experience , think it would be their fau@@ lt .
and so the image of the ar@@ bi@@ di@@ al is that we &apos;re actually getting better , obje@@ ctive , and we
so let me just re@@ mind you .
this is the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma that we &apos;re all holding to really , completely fal@@ se . it &apos;s not true . . . .
there &apos;s no question better than any choice is better than any , but it doesn &apos;t follow that more choice is better than any choice . .
there &apos;s a ma@@ gical crowd . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve mis@@ sed this point of the choice of the collective com@@ modi@@ ties . .
now , as a rule of mine , i &apos;m almost done -- as one set of rules , the thing about thinking about it : what all of these choices are en@@ ab@@ ling in the industri@@ alized societies , the
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard of many of them whose problems are not too big . . . . .
your problem is they have too little . .
so the things i talk about are a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies . . . .
and what &apos;s so fru@@ str@@ ating and un@@ ri@@ vering is , steve le@@ vi@@ tt tells you about how this expensive and hard to qu@@ est , not help you . it &apos;s a waste of money . . . . .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these te@@ urs , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy you don &apos;t help .
they even hurt .
they make it worse for us to stand
if something comes from what makes us make decisions for our society to make decisions too little , not only would the lives of people have been dist@@ ur@@ bed , but what would be impro@@ ved . . . . . . . .
econom@@ ists call this a par@@ e@@ ise impro@@ vement . . econom@@ ists
income income is making sure that everybody else is going -- not just the poor -- because all of these big in@@ geni@@ ables are provi@@ ding
finally , you have to read this carto@@ on , and , you know , a high-@@ powered person , says , &quot; ah ! what does that fish know ? !
you know nothing very much in this gold@@ fish glass . &quot; . &quot;
fa@@ ked phan@@ tom , a short check of the world -- and that is the way i read it first . . .
but as i thought of it , i got the more convinced that the fish i think was something . .
because the truth is , if you break the gold fish glass , so everything is possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . you have a breath . . man@@ age .
if you break the gold fish glass , so everything is possible , you put the happiness . satis@@ fac@@ tion . .
they &apos;re increasing the paraly@@ sis and they &apos;re po@@ uring the happiness .
everybody needs a gold fish glass . needs
this is almost limited to limited security -- possibly for fish , definitely for us . for us
but it &apos;s got a reci@@ pe from a metaph@@ or@@ ical gold@@ fish glass is a reci@@ pe for el@@ ity , and , i guess , cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects already , about the human genome , and what this might mean , and the finding of new groups .
in fact , we &apos;re starting to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze the new point : we &apos;re di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed , and now we &apos;re trying to get from the digital code into a new phase of biology by creating new lives and building
we &apos;ve always been trying to ask the big questions . .
what is life ? it &apos;s something i think many of the bi@@ ologists tried to understand and that &apos;s in different levels .
we &apos;ve tried a variety of approach@@ es to simpli@@ fy it to the minim@@ um components
we have , almost 20 years of di@@ gi@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed , but when we sequen@@ ced the human genome , we turned it from anal@@ o@@ g world to the digital world of computers . . .
now , to ask whether we can re@@ generate life , or whether we can create new life , from that digital universe ? from that
this is the map of a small organis@@ m , my@@ cop@@ las@@ ma , or the world &apos;s small@@ est genome , which has the small@@ est genome in a species &apos;s lab to repli@@ cate itself , and we &apos;ve tried to do that with a smaller genome . . .
we &apos;ve managed to get into about a hundred genes from 500 or so , which are here . . .
but if you look at these me@@ tab@@ oli@@ c map that &apos;s very simple , compared to ours , and trust me , it &apos;s just du@@ de . but if you look at all of these genes we can have one after another , it &apos;s very un@@ likely that this would lead to a living cell . .
so we decided that the only way to move forward is this chromo@@ some actually syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zing what allows us to vari@@ fy the individual components and ask some of the
and so we started asking , can we start a chromo@@ some syn@@ thetic ? ? ti@@
does it allow the chemistry to make these really big molecules that never happened before ?
and , if we can do that , we can start the chromo@@ some
a chromo@@ some is so far off , just a piece of virtual material . . .
our steps at the di@@ gi@@ ti@@ st of life were exponenti@@ al . . . . our
our ability to write genetic code has been very slow , but we &apos;ve yet pro@@ se@@ cu@@ ted , and our final point would now put in an exponenti@@ al cur@@ ve . .
we started out 15 years ago . .
for a number of years , it was starting to start with a bio@@ eth@@ ical re@@ view , before we did the first experiments
it turns out that dna syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zation is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make small pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long but it &apos;s a de@@ gener@@ ative process that &apos;s the longer you make a piece , the more er@@ r@@ ors can come . the more
so we had to develop a new method that we put these little pieces together and have the mista@@ kes cor@@ rec@@ ted .
this was our first try , starting with digital information , the ph@@ i ph@@ i x 17@@ 4 . in 17@@ 4
it &apos;s a little virus that kill@@ s bacteria .
we made small pieces , made a er@@ ror cor@@ rec@@ ter , and we had a dna molecule from about 5,000 letters .
the exciting stage came when we took this piece of chemistry and gave it into a bacteri@@ um , and the bacteria began to read the genetic code and made it vir@@ al-@@ particles . .
the vi@@ ral particles were rele@@ ased then by the cells , and they came back and kill e@@ . col@@ i .
recently , i &apos;ve been talking to the oil industry , and they said that they were doing
they laugh@@ ed more than her . .
this is how we think this is a situation in the software actually can build your hard@@ ware in a biological system . .
but we wanted to go far further . we wanted to build a whole bacteri@@ al chromo@@ some , and it has more than 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters of code . so , we thought we &apos;d build it in c@@ asse@@ ts at the size of the virus that we could measure the size of the c@@ asse@@ tte c@@ asse@@ tte , to understand what the individual compon@@ ent
design when is we the first key sequen@@ , ced and the if genome you in start 199@@ with 5 digital , information the in er@@ the ror
computer rate , was these at digital a information given really $ has 10,000 to pair be of a pa@@ mis@@ irs er@@ . able . .
we found out of sen@@ ti@@ ment , 30 er@@ r@@ ors , and if we had used the original sequence wouldn &apos;t have been possible . . . . . .
part of design is to create pieces that are 50 letters long , and over@@ la@@ p with other 5@@ 0-@@ letter steps to build down smaller sub-@@ un@@ its so that they fit together . . . .
we have unique elements here . .
you may have heard that we have water@@ sign built . .
think about it : we have a 4@@ -@@ letter code : a , c , g and t. .
so , the tri@@ ple@@ ts of these letters -- these letters co@@ verage about 20 amin@@ o aci@@ ds , and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amin@@ o aci@@
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , phr@@ ase , thoughts .
we only sig@@ ned up . . . .
some people were dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted that it was no poetry .
we &apos;ve built the pieces so that we could just break them into enzy@@ mes , and there are enzy@@ mes that re@@ pair them and put it together
and we &apos;ve started to make pieces , starting with g@@ ap@@ s , the fif@@ ths to 17 , and put these together around 24@@ ,000 letters , put it together , to get up to about 2@@ 2,000 .
in every single step , we have extra@@ cted these pieces in the over@@ -@@ stop , so we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very rob@@ ust process that will see in one minute .
we tried to get to the point of auto@@ ma@@ tion . .
so , this looks like a bas@@ ket@@ ball pla@@ ster . .
if we get to these really big pieces -- with 100,000 base pa@@ irs -- these aren &apos;t going to be growing in e@@ . col@@ i , and it &apos;s going to be over@@ wh@@ el@@ med , and it &apos;s so far that all the ways we developed modern
we knew about a mechan@@ ism of a mechan@@ ism that biology uses to fix dna that can allow for the kinds of pieces of dna to fit
here &apos;s an example of one . there is one organis@@ m called d@@ ein@@ o@@ co@@ c@@ c@@ us radi@@ o@@ dur@@ ans at the end of radiation . . .
you see in the upp@@ er field that his chromo@@ some just falls apart . . .
12 to 24 hours later , it &apos;s been re@@ vel@@ ed as it was . in the way
we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
these organisms can be totally bur@@ nt , they can even live in the vac@@ u@@ um .
i &apos;m absolutely sure that life will exist in space and move around a@@ qua@@ tic conditions . . . .
in fact , nasa has shown it &apos;s out there . . .
here &apos;s a gest@@ ure of the molecule that we created by using these processes -- in fact , we &apos;ve been using a lot of bre@@ e@@ -@@ plus , which is the right design of the pieces we &apos;ve mis@@ sed
this is not a direct microscop@@ e , it &apos;s a rain@@ -@@ reg@@ ul@@ ated microscop@@ e . .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can actually see it with the light microscop@@ e
these are foot@@ age of six seconds . foot@@ age .
that &apos;s the publi@@ cation we &apos;ve just done recently . . .
that &apos;s over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters of gene@@ tic@@ ism , and it &apos;s the largest molecule with its cognitive structure ever created by people
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million
if we print it with a prin@@ ter of 10 and without in@@ sur@@ gen@@ cy , it would take 14@@ 2 pages , just to print these genetic code
how do we start a chromo@@ some ? how do we start it ? activ@@ ating it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus , and it &apos;s much more complicated to deal with bacteria
it &apos;s just easier to do it in eu@@ kar@@ y@@ on@@ ates that we &apos;re doing : just get the nu@@ cle@@ us out and gives another water into it , and that &apos;s exactly what you all heard about c@@ lon@@ ing . .
when you &apos;re arch@@ a@@ e@@ bacteri@@ ous , the chromo@@ some is in the cell , but only recently , we &apos;ve shown that you can take a complete transp@@ l@@ ant of a chromo@@ some from one cell to another , and that activ@@
we were cle@@ an@@ ing out the chromo@@ some of a micro@@ can@@ ic species , and roughly , these two are as far apart as humans and mi@@ ce . and we gave some extra genes to help them get this chromo@@ some . we were using enzy@@ mes around all proteins , and it was very amazing than we were giving it into a cell -- and they &apos;re going to have our very exten@@ sive graphic here . . in this
the new chromo@@ some went into the cell .
we actually thought that this is the end , but we tried to get a little further on this process . . . .
this is the main mechan@@ ism of evolution here . here
we find all sorts of species here that had a second chromo@@ some or a third of any of where , every time , thousands of people , are ad@@ ding to one species to one
so people who think evolution is as an gene that &apos;s changing a lot of biology has a lot of biology mis@@ sed
there are enzy@@ mes that are called the restri@@ ction enzy@@ mes that actually di@@ gest
the chromo@@ some that was in the cell &apos;s cell , the chromo@@ some , which we &apos;ve em@@ bed@@ ded .
it was ex@@ posed to the cell , and recogni@@ zed the other chromo@@ some material , and we ended up having a cell with a new chromo@@ some . . . .
it was blue because of the genes that we had con@@ stra@@ ined
and after a very short time , it was lost all the characteri@@ stics of species and re@@ turning completely into a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given in the cell . .
and all the proteins changed the mem@@ bran@@ es of the mem@@ bran@@ es , when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we trans@@ fer@@ red
it may sound like the genom@@ ic al@@ ch@@ im@@ a sound , but we can do things quite dra@@ matically . , we can change things quite dra@@ matically
now i &apos;m argu@@ ing this is not the pro@@ gen@@ is -- that &apos;s in 3@@ .@@ 5 billion years of evolution . evolution is
and i argu@@ ed that perhaps we can create a new kind of cam@@ brian explosion where there could be massive new ar@@ mal education based on this digital design . . .
why should we do that
i think it &apos;s quite obvious in terms of what we need . .
we &apos;re about six and a half to nine billion people in the next 40 years . . .
to put it in my context : i was born in 194@@ 6 . born
today , three people on the planet have since now since in 194@@ 6 , in 194@@ 6 , it will be four . four years . .
we have trouble with food , with fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for 6@@ .@@ 5 billion people . . .
it will be a challenge that for 9 / 7 . . .
we need about five billion tons of coal , 3@@ 0-@@ plus billion s@@ light oil . that &apos;s a hundred million be@@ ads a day . . .
when we think about biological processes , or any process to replace that , it will be a huge challenge . , it will
then , of course , there &apos;s the entire carbon from that material that &apos;s land@@ ed in the atmosphere
so , we have , from our disco@@ ver@@ ies , from our disco@@ ver@@ ies of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that those are the design components of the future .
electr@@ on@@ ics du@@ mp had a do@@ zen components , and look at the diversity that we &apos;ve come from . . .
we &apos;re going to see the limit@@ s of biological reality and of those of ourselves
we have technologies that have this fast syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zing metho@@ d@@ ology to do that what we call combin@@ at@@ or@@ al gene@@ tics . .
we have the ability to build a big robot that can make millions of chromo@@ som@@ es a day . .
if you can imagine that 20 million different genes , or those processes to optimi@@ ze , to make the ex@@ act , to make the new v@@ acc@@ ine , we can change more molecular biology than the last 20 years . science . science . science . science . science .
and it &apos;s just times sele@@ ction . we can sele@@ ct life cap@@ ability , production of chemicals or fuel production and so on . .
this is a picture of actual design software that we &apos;re working with , actually , that you can actually sit down and design new species on the computer . image
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how it &apos;s going to look , and we know exactly what it is that we know
we &apos;re now foc@@ using on fuel in the fourth generation .
you saw the ma@@ ize recently to eth@@ an@@ ol , just a bad experiment . .
we have dri@@ ll@@ ine fuel in the two-@@ - and third generation that will come out and get a relatively quickly out of the higher sugar value , like oc@@ tan , different kinds of bu@@ tan@@ ol . .
but , as we think , the only way we think biology makes a powerful impact without any of the time in food or the limit@@ ation of their avail@@ ability is going to have to have co2 as ex@@ pos@@ ure , and therefore we &apos;re working on cells that are
and we think that we &apos;re going to be the green@@ fu@@ els of the fourth generation , and
sun@@ light and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all sorts of different ways . .
this is an organis@@ m we described in 199@@ 6 .
he lives in the deep sea , about one-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half miles deep , near almost cooking temper@@ atures . . in
it turns carbon into me@@ than@@ e , under the use of hydrogen , for energy
we &apos;re going to study whether we can use stor@@ age of growing cells that could easily be used to measure , conver@@ t co2 to push this process . . .
within a short period of time , we believe we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life . in a short time of time .
you know , we really -- moder@@ ate a@@ sto@@ ws like the re@@ plac@@ ement of the pe@@ tro@@ chemical industry -- exactly . if you can &apos;t do that at ted , where else ? a major source of energy . energy .
but that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing now is to de@@ com@@ pose the same approach@@ ing to the development of vac@@ cin@@ es .
they saw it with the flu this year , we &apos;re always off and we &apos;re always off , and we have a dollar to stop in the right
i think that this can be changed by putting re@@ com@@ men@@ ded vac@@ cin@@ es in the window .
that &apos;s how the future might look , to be the evolution of the world with changes , can be acceler@@ ated with syn@@ thetic bacteria , arch@@ a@@ en , and poten@@ tially eu@@ kar@@ y@@ on@@ ates . .
we are re@@ moved from humans to improve human years , and our goal is that we have an opportunity to survive long enough to possibly do that . thank you . . .
in the last ted conference , i was a introdu@@ ction to the l@@ h@@ c
and i was talking to you , to tell you what the machine works . . .
so it &apos;s so far . and for those who didn &apos;t come there at the time , the l@@ h@@ c is the biggest scientific experiment ever de@@ vot@@ ed -- 27 kilometers in
his job is to create the conditions which exi@@ sted less than a billi@@ on@@ th of a second from the universe -- up to 600 million times within a second . up
it &apos;s just brea@@ th@@ taking . .
this is the machine below gen@@ ev@@ a .
we take images of these mini@@ -@@ big bang in dete@@ ctors . .
this is me , i &apos;m in this . he &apos;s called the at@@ las simul@@ ator -- 4@@ 4 meters in diam@@ e@@ ter , 22 meters in diam@@
here &apos;s a spec@@ tac@@ ular image of the at@@ las in the construction of the construction so
and last year , the machine came out for the first time . . . .
and this picture was taken by at@@ las .
it caused im@@ men@@ se ju@@ bel in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first ray of ar@@ r@@ ine that le@@ tt@@ ed the l@@ h@@ c down the l@@ h@@ c , then inten@@ tion with a part of the l@@ h@@ c colli@@ ded to leave a rain of particles on
in other words , when we saw this picture on the 10@@ th of september , we knew that this machine was working , which is a big
i don &apos;t know if this was the biggest for@@ cing , or that , as somebody went to the google side , and found the front page .
it means we &apos;ve reach@@ ed a cultural impact against the scientific im@@
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that was here with these wir@@ es -- this gol@@ den wir@@ es here .
these v@@ au@@ d en@@ ab@@ led 13@@ -@@ plus traffic lights when the machine goes to high-@@
well , the engineers , you &apos;ll see them , and say , &quot; no , don &apos;t you . these are little wir@@ es . &quot;
you can do that because when you cool them very far , they become called super@@ conduc@@ tors . .
at min@@ us 2@@ 7@@ 1 degrees , col@@ der than the space between the space can make this ten@@ sion . . .
in one of the connections , between the nin@@ e-@@ thousand mag@@ ts in the l@@ h@@ c , there was a de@@ fe@@ ct atta@@ ched
and so , the dra@@ g@@ ged dra@@ g@@ ged and a half thousand traffic en@@ counter@@ s suddenly en@@ coun@@ ter electr@@
this was the result .
now , all of this is more amazing when you imagine that the magne@@ ts have been over 20 tons of mag@@ ni@@ tude and shif@@
we actually dama@@ ged about 50 of the magne@@ ts .
and they had to re@@ move what we did . .
we &apos;ve got them rein@@ forced , re@@ pair them .
they &apos;re all on their way back . . .
by the end mar@@ ch , the l@@ h@@ c will be able to make it work again
we &apos;re going to turn it on , and expect for first data to be able to collect , in jun@@ e , or ju@@ ly , and then we put our journey on trying to figure out
now , of course , in a form of dis@@ pu@@ tes such as acci@@ dents of acci@@ dents , the debate about the value of science and engineering is to have such a jo@@
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard to reach the fact that we reach beyond our limit@@ s , is the value of things like the l@@ h@@ c .
i &apos;m going to leave my final words of english in english . hum@@ ph@@ re@@ y da@@ vy , who i think is , when he de@@ f@@ actu@@ red the us@@ eless experiments of his teaching defen@@ se , his app@@ r@@ enti@@ ce was michael far@@ a@@ day , and that &apos;s a tale of con@@ qu@@ ering the dis@@ par@@ ate experiments of the human mind , that our science shows up to be a myster@@ y of nature , and there &apos;s no new worl@@ ds to con@@ qu@@ er . &quot; &quot; is so dangerous to the developing world of
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
writing books is my job , but of course it &apos;s more than that . than
it and &apos;s i also don my &apos;t big expect , that li@@ to
fel@@ change ong . love and . fascin@@ ation . .
but shor@@ tly , shor@@ ter thing in my life and my career has done that , which has led me completely to re@@ think my relationship to this work . . . . . .
this particular event was that i wrote a book recently -- a bi@@ ograph@@ y called the v@@ na@@ e , pra@@ y , love -- that , they were , unlike all my previous books for whatever reason , for whatever reason , and a large me@@ ga@@ -@@ event , became an international fin@@ e-@@ discipl@@ ine thing . a big me@@ ga@@ -@@
the result is , no matter where i come from , i &apos;ll be a bo@@ und . . .
seriously -- the under@@ turn . a bit .
for example , they &apos;re worried about me and they say , &quot; don &apos;t you sc@@ are you ? never mind you to get this success ? &quot; ? that &apos;s not going to be
don &apos;t you be afraid to write on their entire life , never again ? el@@ even ? nor@@ ding a book that could be interested in the world again ? ? . . .
okay , so that &apos;s really coura@@ ge . .
but it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that i was going to be a teenager about 20 years ago when i first told you that i wanted to be a writer with the same kind of fear of fear . a con@@ fron@@ tation was con@@ fron@@ ted with the same kind of
people said , you know , you don &apos;t have any fear , you &apos;ve never succe@@ e@@ ded .
do you worry you &apos;re not afraid to kill the hu@@ g of a re@@ je@@ ction
you &apos;re not afraid you went through this man@@ date , and you &apos;re going to see your life , and you &apos;re going to die there , and you &apos;re going to die on a jun@@ t@@ n box -- your mouth with the bit@@ ter a@@ wer ? . .
that &apos;s something , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is : do yes .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and i &apos;d always . .
and i was an@@ x@@ ous to a couple more things ago that nobody would ever re@@ mind . .
like al@@ ga@@ e -- and others sc@@ ary things . sc@@ ary .
but , when it &apos;s writing about writing , i &apos;ve just been looking at it , and i &apos;m like , why ? ? . .
is that reas@@ on@@ able ? ?
is it logi@@ cal that someone should be expected to do the work that he &apos;s making the work that he feels ? ? ?
and what about the creative enter@@ prise that we &apos;re going to do with the creative enter@@ prise , you &apos;re un@@ safe about the inter@@ ests of the world -- in a way that &apos;s not func@@ tional to others ?
my father , for example , was chem@@ ist , and i can &apos;t speak in his 40 years as a chem@@ ist he was asked to be afraid to be chemi@@ sts . . he was asked to be
with your chem@@ ist b@@ loo@@ dy , john -- how are you going to do
it just didn &apos;t come out of you , you know ?
but to be fair -- the man@@ co@@ hol group group have not received the repu@@ tation of al@@ co@@ hol addi@@ cts , people who are getting into risk with al@@ co@@ hol addi@@ cts .
we seem to have this kind of call , but not only the wri@@ ters , but the creative all of the gen@@ r@@ es , it seems to have this repu@@ tation , ment@@ ally un@@ stable . . . .
all they have to do is to look at the bit@@ ter dea@@ ths of really great minds just from the t@@ wen@@ tie@@ th century that young and often died from their hand . . . .
and even the ones that didn &apos;t actually give people the su@@ i@@ ci@@ des to really be emp@@ ted by their tal@@ ents . .
nor@@ man ma@@ il@@ er before his death in his last interview : double one of my books had a little bit further . . . .
and an extraordinary stat@@ ement that you can do about this kind of life .
but we don &apos;t even miss someone &apos;s saying , because we know this kind of stat@@ ement for as long ago , we &apos;ve known the notion so long and we accept it as an innovative accep@@ t that creativity and suffering , of course , is related to the coun@@ us , and that art -- always leads to the sea equ@@ al . .
the question i want to make today is : is this an idea of you complete ? ? ?
feel with it ? because at a centi@@ meter , i don &apos;t really feel like i feel with this notion of this notion of this notion of view , i don &apos;t really
i find them off . . .
and i find them dangerous , and i don &apos;t want to see them being taken over the next century . . .
i think it &apos;s better if we &apos;re going to live our big creative as@@ ti@@
and i know , i definitely know that -- in my situation , very dangerous to start , to start the cre@@ w of the gu@@ esses , to sort of cre@@ di@@ ble in the way i &apos;m in my career . in my career . in my
this is -- look , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m only about 40 years old . . . .
i may have another 30 hours of un@@ working years . .
and it &apos;s most likely that everything i &apos;m going to write from now is the world &apos;s work , which is what &apos;s been done after the de@@ for@@ est@@ ation of my last book , right ? ? ?
i &apos;m saying it &apos;s fair because we &apos;re all sort of friends here -- it &apos;s very likely that my biggest success is behind me . . . . .
oh , jesus , what kind of thought !
these are the kind of thoughts that could get somebody to get to get nine o &apos;@@ clock in the morning , drink g@@ in . and i don &apos;t want to . . .
i would rather have to do this work that i love . .
so the question is : how ? ?
and after some time of refle@@ cting , i think , to continue to write fe@@ atures , to design a kind of sho@@ ot@@ ing psych@@ ological constru@@ ct . . . . . . . . . .
and i have to figure out a way to have a way to have a safe distance to keep in a distance to myself and my very natural pl@@ um@@ me@@ ting of how reaction will be to the slide . . .
so as i &apos;ve looked at the research models for models in the last year , i &apos;ve been looking for the past , and i &apos;ve been trying to find other societies to see if they might have been better or more sensi@@ ble ideas about how to help creative interven@@ tions , with the emotional risks associated with creativity . risks of creativity . with the emotional
this is a qu@@ est that made me ancient gre@@ e@@ ce , and the old ro@@
please follow me , because the circle will be close to the end .
but in ancient gre@@ e@@ ce , people have not believed that creativity comes from people , okay ? ? . . . .
they believed that creativity was a kind of di@@ v@@ ine di@@ aper mind that comes from a dist@@ ant , un@@ known source to people , from un@@ expla@@ in@@ able , un@@ known reasons .
the gre@@ e@@ ks called these go@@ v@@ ine di@@ ty gei@@ gers of creativity aro@@ se . . . . .
from soc@@ rates , he was known to believe he had a do@@ t that was on top of his distance . .
the ro@@ bes had the same idea , called this kind of body lo@@ f@@ ty , a geni@@ us of this kind of body
that &apos;s great . the ro@@ man didn &apos;t really think that a geni@@ us was a particularly smart individual . .
they believed that a geni@@ us was this kind of magic of di@@ v@@ eness , which was thought that literally he lives into the walls of an artist -- about almost like par@@ l@@ over , the house of house@@ -@@ school -- that would be the sho@@ ck and the artist in work kind of seemed invisible to form , and the result of the work would be kind of invisible
that &apos;s brilliant -- there &apos;s the distance , which i talked about -- the psych@@ ological constru@@ ct that you &apos;ve talked about -- the psych@@ ological constru@@ ct that prote@@ cts you
and everybody knew it worked so well , right ? ?
the artist of aging was prote@@ cted , like , like , too much sc@@ ales , like , for example , too much .
if your work was , you know , you didn &apos;t look at you all in the watch , everybody knew you had this d@@ ous@@ ing geni@@ us that helped you .
if your work was flying -- not entirely your fau@@ lt , right ? ?
everybody knew your geni@@ us was a bit of a cra@@ p
so people thought of creativity for a long time . . . . .
and then the ren@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance , and everything changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human person@@ nel at the center of the universe -- of all go@@ ds and myster@@ ies , and there is no room to think of my@@ tic creatures that are coming from the di@@ v@@ ine .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational human@@ ism and people started to believe that creativity came from just any individual . . . .
for the first time in history you &apos;re going to hear people this or spo@@ ken artists , but instead of having a geni@@ us . . . .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake . .
you know ? i think that a single person to allow him to think he or she &apos;s like the bu@@ d , how the bu@@ mp and the essen@@ ce and the power of all di@@ v@@ ine , creative , un@@ known , un@@ known myster@@ y is a little too much responsibility for them to have a fra@@ c@@ ti@@ ous , human psychology . . . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ;
it &apos;s like asking someone to s@@ hr@@ ink the sun .
and this defin@@ es all of the dis@@ pos@@ able , and it produ@@ ces all of those un@@ able expec@@ tations to the success .
i think that this achie@@ v@@ ements of success our artists have de@@ cre@@ ased the past 500 years .
and , if that &apos;s true -- and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question . . .
can we change it ? ,
maybe an es@@ -@@ opening understanding of the relationship between people and the myster@@ y of creativity . .
maybe not .
maybe we can not just er@@ adi@@ cate the thou@@ ght@@ fully of 500 years of rational human@@ ism in an 18@@
and there &apos;s certainly people in this audience who are really focused on the scientific dou@@ bt that they would be thinking about -- basically , soli@@ d people follow and fe@@ at@@ en@@ ist on their projects and so on . . .
i but &apos;m the probably question not i going want to to take throw you on all is to
: that why journey not . ? . ? . . .
why not think about it ? not so
because a it process makes that a -- lot as of everyone sense knows how , everything who i &apos;s &apos;ve ever heard trying about to when do it something was -- about so expla@@
in ining other the words absolutely , crazy everybody fre@@ here ely -- of not creative always process gu@@ . il@@ ty . . . . . .
in fact , sometimes it can feel like par@@ alle@@ l . . .
i had recently met a meeting that i met the extraordinary american poetry ru@@ th stone , who &apos;s now about 90 , but only her life was di@@ min@@ a@@ ged , but she was told her whole life , she was very much in the fields , she said she can feel her and hear her po@@ em about the landscape . she said she can feel her and hear her po@@ em about the landscape . she
she said it was like a ra@@ il train from air . .
it &apos;s going to roll across the land . . . .
she felt when it came , because it would take the earth under its feet to the be@@
she knew she could do that in that moment , and that was -- in her words , race like the de@@ vil cr@@ ash@@ es . like the
they ran as the de@@ vil &apos;s he@@ ck to the house while they were pur@@ su@@ ed by this po@@ em , and it was really clear that they had to go fast enough to a piece of paper and a pen@@ cil to put it in the ch@@ ase , and they could hit on the she@@ et . .
and other paint was not fast enough . she ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t get the house , and the po@@ em was roll@@ ing through her , and she was able to do it , and she said , look for a different po@@ et . . . . . . . . .
and then there were these moments -- i never forget -- i never forget it -- she said that there was moments where they actually made it . . .
so she &apos;s running to the house and looking after paper and the po@@ em &apos;s going through her and she &apos;s grab@@ bing a pen in it just by walking through her and then -- she said -- she said -- was it like to pick up your other hand and get it to stick . it was like to
she came up with the po@@ em , and he pulled it back into her body , and she took it on the she@@ et of paper . .
these are the opportunities in these opportunities , and in@@ t@@ act on paper -- but back@@ wards from the last word for the first word . for the first word .
when i heard that , i thought that this was un@@ lo@@ cked -- that &apos;s exactly as my creative process comple@@ ted . .
this is not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the chan@@ nel . . .
i &apos;m a mo@@ w@@ ering . i have to work on work , i have to stand up every day and swe@@ at , and i &apos;m really un@@ pleas@@ ant . &apos;@@ ung@@ el@@ ill@@ ar . my cal@@ m .
but even in my mouth , i sometimes have this thing blo@@ wn up . . . . . .
and i guess many of you have done this . .
i even had any ideas or i had ideas coming through by a source that i really cannot be able to identify . .
what is this thing ? one
and how do we deal with it without having a relationship in relation to that , and we actually have a mental health experience in the way that we &apos;re passionate about it ?
for me , the best example of how you can do this can be the musi@@ cian tom wa@@ its . i had been allowed to interview it a few years ago . a magazine . . .
we talked about this top@@ ic . and you know what ? most of his life was tom that was the em@@ bo@@ died modern artist who was trying to com@@ mit this un@@ controlled creative impul@@ se that was in it , to com@@ pla@@ in this un@@ controlled creative impul@@ se that was in it , to be
but then he became older and quie@@ t . he told me that one day he went on a high@@ way in los angeles , and all this changed all around him . . . .
he went at high speed when he suddenly heard a little frag@@ ment of a tun@@ e , which is often a little frag@@ ment in inspiration , and he wants to have it . she &apos;s great . he &apos;s le@@ vi@@ ty . he &apos;s going to have to do it . gl@@ ori@@ ous , but he can &apos;t make it . he did it . he s@@
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen , he doesn &apos;t have a c@@ asse@@ tte record . .
so he starts to get up this old sc@@ aling up in him , like i &apos;m going to lose this thing and i &apos;ll be followed by this song at e@@ ternal . . . . . .
i &apos;m not good enough , i &apos;m not making it . .
but instead of getting in pan@@ ic , he just heard .
he finished all the thoughts , and she did something completely new . .
he just looked up in the sky , and he said , &quot; exc@@ use me , can &apos;t you see that i &apos;m driving ? &quot;
and if i look at it like i was just going to put up a
if you really want to exist , come on to be a more gu@@ ar-@@ gener@@ ating moment when i can take care of
now , if you &apos;re not , you know ,
go his and whole see job leon@@ process ard has
co@@ changed hen . . . .
not the work itself . it was often the dark itself , and it was still dark as
but the process and the heavy sc@@ aling that surro@@ unded it was li@@ f@@ ted up when he took the geni@@ us , where he took the geni@@ us , where he was sort of coming back , and he realized that there &apos;s no in@@ her@@ it@@ ance , cros@@ s-@@ like thing . . . . . .
it could give a really cru@@ m@@ pl@@ ing , wonder , bizar@@ re collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and stran@@ gen@@ y , out@@ going , ex@@ ternal thing that was
when i heard this story , it also kind of changed a little bit the way i worked and it &apos;s been taking me . .
and this idea , when i was in the middle of a sk@@ art of gi@@ g@@ gling gi@@ y , love was center , and i fell into one of those gu@@ ts of the second , which we all fall when we work on something and it doesn &apos;t work . you start to think that it &apos;s going to be a disaster . that &apos;s going to be the worst book ever written . the
not only bad , but of all time . .
i started thinking , i should just get this on a project .
but then i reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ed tom in the deep sky , and i tried to do it
so i li@@ ft my view from the man@@ us@@ cri@@ pt and i talked to my comm@@ ents in the next corner of the room . . .
i spoke to you , &quot; listen , you , you , you , you , you , you know , if that book is not bri@@ ll@@ y , it &apos;s not completely my
because you see i &apos;m doing everything i have , invest . i don &apos;t have more than that . than that .
so if you want to have better , you have to del@@ ay up and ins@@ ert your percentage of the re@@ ference .
okay . but , if you don &apos;t do that , you know what the hell of it . .
i &apos;m still going to write on it , because that &apos;s my job
and i want to give you a proto@@ co@@ l that i was here today for my part of the jobs . .
because ... by the end , it &apos;s like the follo@@ ws , and it &apos;s been a cent@@ u@@ ries ago , in northern africa , people were gather@@ ing in the moon of mol@@ ds with sa@@ int dan@@ cers and music that had been dis@@ per@@ sed for hours -- until the morning .
these soli@@ d soli@@ d were an incredibly great thing , because the dan@@ cers were professional , and they were fantastic .
but again , very rare , something very rare happened . one of the cre@@ ators was actually trans@@ national . . . . . .
and i know that you know what i mean , because i know you &apos;ve all seen this kind of a performance of performance . . . .
it was like the time the time was still standing and the dan@@ cers were running around by a p@@ ill@@ a , and he did nothing different than he ever did -- 1,000 ni@@ ghts before . but everything was per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ating .
and all of a sudden he couldn &apos;t get into human@@ -@@ human . a human@@ -@@
it was poin@@ ted out by the inside , and then from the bottom , and all the lights started by a di@@ v@@ ine fire
when this happened then , people knew what this was . they called it at their name . . . . .
they put the hands together , and they started sing@@ ing : the al@@ al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , god , god , god . , god
that &apos;s god , you know ?
interesting ted@@ histor@@ ic foot@@ note : when the audience got into the south spa@@ in , they took this use of action : the action changed over the cent@@ u@@ ries of ada@@ al@@ ary , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , who is still going to be fighting and fl@@ atten@@ ing and fl@@ atten@@ ing and gu@@ pu@@ t . . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
when an ac@@ tors in spa@@ in , in a little impossible , do something ma@@ gical did : squ@@ ee@@ la@@ h , ol@@ é , ol@@ é , al@@ la@@ h , great , bra@@ vo dan@@ ger , there is , &quot; a vol@@ a@@ tile look on god . &quot; .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
but the tri@@ cky part followed by the morning when dan@@ cers themselves wake themselves and reali@@ zes that at 11 o &apos;@@ clock , there &apos;s 11 o &apos;@@ clock at a tu@@ titude -- and he &apos;s no longer in it for a five-@@ minute of god .
it &apos;s just an aging mortality rate , and maybe it will never rise to the hei@@ ghts . . too ever . . .
and maybe someone will ever call god &apos;s name , if he &apos;s ro@@ ot , but what do he do with the rest of his life ? ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most pain@@ ful cor@@ rec@@ tions of a creative life . . .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be quite as much as p@@ in if you didn &apos;t believe the most amazing aspe@@ cts of your existence . , that the most extraordinary aspe@@ cts of their existence are brought
if you just believe that you &apos;re a whe@@ el@@ man -- from an un@@ belie@@ vable source to a re@@ it@@ u@@ re-@@ type of their life , which is passed on to someone else , if you &apos;re done . . .
if we start thinking about this , all of this changes . . . .
so i started thinking , and so i &apos;m certainly in the last few months , as i was working on the book that will soon appear -- than the dangerous , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing , incredibly expected follo@@ wn of my des@@ cen@@ dan@@ ts . . . . sc@@ ary . . .
what i have to tell myself when i &apos;m going to be crazy about this is , don &apos;t i fear . . . .
don &apos;t be dis@@ coura@@ ged .
just make your job .
whether it &apos;s still for your contribu@@ tion , whatever he is to be .
if your job is the dance , dance . .
if du@@ m@@ b di@@ v@@ ine di@@ v@@ ine , which is the side of that , decide to be able to show you your wei@@ ght@@ ness for a moment , then consu@@ me , then tan@@ ol@@ é ! . . .
and if you don &apos;t , dan@@ cing your dance .
and then bren@@ é ! tough for yourself in all of this .
i believe in and i feel like we should teach . .
t@@ ol@@ é ! nur@@ turing for yourself , just for you to have the bare human love and your own meaning , for you . you have to do it
thank thank you you

last year , i showed these two sli@@ des to illu@@ strate that the arc@@ tic ice cap@@ ice , which had close to three million years , had s@@ hr@@ in@@ k to 40 percent of america in the bottom , in 40 percent . a few .
but it doesn &apos;t push strong enough to look at this particular problem because it doesn &apos;t show the thi@@ ck of the ice .
in a sense , the arc@@ tic ice cap@@ s have the heart of our global global global system . .
it gro@@ ws in the winter and s@@ hr@@ in@@ king in
the next slide i &apos;m going to show you is a ti@@ me@@ -@@ lap@@ se recor@@ ding of what happened in the last 25
the perman@@ ent ice is covered with red . ice
you can see , it &apos;s head@@ ed on the dark blue , this is the an@@ nu@@ al ice in winter , and it &apos;s s@@ hr@@ in@@ king
what we call perman@@ ence , five years old , is almost like blood that &apos;s out of the body here . . out of the body here .
in 25 years , it &apos;s gone to here . here to
this is a problem , because the other population of warming is to look at the fro@@ zen ocean to have a big amount of fro@@ zen carbon , which , if you look at the micro@@ bes to me@@ than@@ e . . . from
compared to the full amount of climate shif@@ ts in the atmosphere , could double that figure actually double when we cross this cri@@ tically important point
today , in some of the la@@ kes of la@@ kes , in al@@ as@@ ka me@@ than@@ e from itself from the water . from the
professor kat@@ ey wal@@ ter at the university of al@@ as@@ ka is a new set of work on another flat in the last winter last winter .
wow ! !
you &apos;re doing fine . the question is , how is it going
and one reason is , this vast war@@ m@@ top war@@ e@@ house war@@ h is a green@@ land from
this is a an@@ nu@@ al di@@ al river .
but the volu@@ me of volu@@ me is a lot bigger than
this is the can@@ uss@@ -@@ su@@ a@@ ce@@ q river in sou@@ th@@ west green@@ land .
if you want to know what marine sea levels melt down in land is swe@@ et up here . swe@@ et . swe@@ e@@ lands
these ri@@ vers get ra@@ pid . .
on the other end of the planet , ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , the biggest ice mass on the planet .
and last month , researchers repor@@ ted that the entire continent has a negative ice foot@@
and the west ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , which is di@@ pped up on under@@ water terri@@ tory , is particularly very active in mel@@ ting .
this is 20 foot of ocean level , as is green@@ land . as green@@
in the hi@@ mal@@ a@@ y@@ as , the third largest ice mass , you see there &apos;s a new la@@ kes in the upp@@ er world a few years ago . .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drin@@ k@@ less water . . .
in the an@@ ger , this gl@@ aci@@ ers is the water source for this city . . .
the amount of water has increas@@ ed .
but if they sett@@ se@@ ed , most of the drin@@ king water will fall away
in california , a 6@@ 0-@@ percent redu@@ ction in the s@@ now cei@@ ling of the si@@ er@@ ra .
this is the stor@@ age of the memory .
and the predi@@ ctions of how they &apos;ve read them are serious .
these ex@@ ro@@ th@@ ing in the world leads to a dra@@ matic increase in fire .
and the cat@@ astrop@@ he all around the world has never been able to ex@@ tend ex@@ clu@@ si@@ vely . .
four times what &apos;s in the previous 30 years , like in the previous 7@@ 5@@
this is an entirely un@@ sustainable development pattern .
if you look at this in the histor@@ ical cor@@ relation , you can see what it is
in the past five years , we &apos;ve been able to produce 70 million tons of co2 dio@@ xide , 25 million tons every day into the oceans
look at the area of east pacific , from the american continent , western and par@@ tly , in the state of sub@@ continent , where there is a dra@@ matic dec@@ line in oxygen in the ocean . . in the ocean .
the biggest single factor for global warming , bes@@ i@@ des de@@ for@@ est@@ ation , which is 20 percent , is the burning of fossil fu@@ els . .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most large problem .
the united states is one of the largest pollu@@ tors , along with china . with china
and the pro@@ pos@@ al was to build a lot of other co@@ al-@@ fi@@ ghts
but we &apos;re starting to see a change . .
here are the ones that have been caught up in the last few years , with some green alterna@@ tives that were pro@@ posed
but it &apos;s a political situation in our country .
and coal be@@ ams and oil be@@ ams have spent a quar@@ ter billion last cal@@ end@@ ar year to adverti@@ se clean coal , which is already a con@@ tradi@@ ction in itself . . .
this is a picture remin@@ ded me of something
in christ@@ mas around , at me at home in ten@@ nes@@ see , one billion pounds of ko@@ al@@ es@@ cent lam@@ b . .
it seemed to be in the news .
this is in our country of the second largest waste of america . in the americ@@
this happened about christ@@ mas .
one of the commer@@ ci@@ als of the ko@@ y@@ ein@@ du@@ b was this
fro@@ sty , the new man is a pleasure , happy bur@@ den . .
it &apos;s in chi@@ ps and pieces of america in america , and it &apos;s helping our
fro@@ sty , the carbon man is clean every day .
it &apos;s aff@@ ord@@ able , and it &apos;s wor@@ th@@ while , and workers are re@@
this the is most the powerful source tem@@ of po@@ most yer coal is in the
west head virg@@ of ini@@ mas@@ a sey . rock . . .
let me tell you a very clear one : al gore , nan@@ cy ro@@ o@@ s@@ i , har@@ ry rei@@ d , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about
so the alli@@ ance for climate protection has two campaig@@ ns in life .
this is one , a part of it . . .
in co@@ al@@ er@@ g@@ y , climate change is a serious threat to our business . .
so we set it to the top line , spending a significant amount of money to get a commercial to the road , to get the truth about coal . . .
in fact , coal is not dir@@ ty . .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it sm@@ ells even well .
so don &apos;t worry about climate change .
leave that quie@@ t to us .
clean coal , they &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s go a tour of this modern , clean carbon factory . . .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty l@@ oud . .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean car@@ bs .
and yet , of course , burning from the coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , which is remarkable , clean car@@
look at it right now , this is the so@@ und@@ er carbon technology .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge is national security . .
america is in a crisis that is the economy , the national security , the climate
the red thre@@ ad that all of these together is our depen@@ dence on carbon emissions like dir@@ ty coal and foreign oil . from
but now there &apos;s a b@@ old , new solution to get us out of this sort of un@@
the u.s. with 100 percent clean electricity has new , within the next
a plan , the united states , to get back to work , to make ourselves sure and help stop global warming
finally , a solution that &apos;s large enough to solve our problems .
re@@ fresh america . find more . .
this is the last . .
it &apos;s about a new consu@@ mer policy .
one of the fa@@ st@@ est ways to re@@ move our depen@@ dence on old , dir@@ ty fu@@ els that make our world .
the future here is . wind , sun , and a new energy system .
new invest@@ ments , to create good jobs .
the american re@@ public . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african pro@@ ver@@ b : &quot; if you want to be a little bit of wish . .
if you want to get a little , go get , get
we need to get past , and we need
thank you . .
i want to start by asking you to start thinking about your childhood , and when you were playing with the metal pla@@
while they realized how to ex@@ range their hands and attack the c@@ ute , they actually learned to think and start to think , and try and solve problems with understanding and understanding the space and understanding the space .
spa@@ tial thinking is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of our environment . .
as a computer scientist , inspired by the kind of inter@@ actions with real objects -- together with my cre@@ ator pat@@ ti and my fellow steve je@@ ti kal@@ ani@@ th@@ i , i started wonder@@ ing what if we were using computers that instead of a mouse cur@@ ti@@ t that takes like a digital finger@@ ti@@ p that would move like a digital finger@@ ti@@ p on a flat surface of a flat surface ... what if we could interven@@ e with both hands and make data physi@@ cally and could attack them how we want it to be ? person@@
and this question was so profound that we decided to have an answer , and we evolved , and we have
in short , a si@@ de@@ able is an inter@@ active computer at the size of a bis@@ k@@ a . . .
you can move with your hand , you can see each other , you can dete@@ ct your movements and you can have a screen of dy@@ con@@ y . . a
more importantly , are they physi@@ cally , therefore , that you can use it to be made just by the ex@@ clu@@ sion of your
and the si@@ de@@ ables are an example of a new generation of tools to manipu@@ late digital data .
and if these tools become more physical and they develop awareness for their movements , and identify each other , and the ene@@ mi@@ es of our approach@@ es to them , then we can start to study new and enter@@ ta@@ ining interaction species
i &apos;m going to start with some simple examples . .
this si@@ de-@@ bar can re@@ figure to the video rec@@ ren@@ pe@@ red , and when i put it in a ki@@ p , the video will go forward , if i go back in the other direction , it &apos;ll go back@@ wards
and these inter@@ active portra@@ its take place in another . .
so if i place her , it makes you feel interested . .
if you &apos;re surro@@ unded by inv@@ ent@@ ary , you &apos;ll notice that , you can get a little nervous
and you &apos;re feeling like your movement and the tenden@@ cy .
and in one this interesting case result , of we inter@@ &apos;ve actions been that con@@ we ta@@ started ined to three recognize si@@ was bl@@ that ings we as could a apply color everyday po@@ gest@@ ts ures ,
on and data i , can like use color them , to to cast dis@@ paint ru@@ in pt the it middle with of liquid the numbers middle . , where . they &apos;re . mix@@ ed
we can break it back , we can sh@@ ine a little bit . .
there are also some ne@@ at opportunities in education like languages , mathematics or lo@@ k@@ games , where we give people the possibility of fast sk@@ et@@ ches and want to see the results immediately .
here i am -- this is a fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i series that i put in a simple balance program . . .
this is a game with words that are kind of mix@@ ing of sc@@ rab@@ ble and bo@@ g@@ gle . . .
basically you get each r@@ ag@@ s to random random letters , and as you &apos;re trying to form words , they &apos;re che@@ cking up a dic@@ tion@@ ary . . . .
then , after about 30 seconds , again , it &apos;s been mix@@ ed and you &apos;ve got a new letter combin@@ ing new opportunities and new opportunities
thank you .
and these are some of the kids who came to a media lab , and i could get them to try it and i got a video of it . video .
they really loved it .
and one more interesting thing about this kind of appli@@ cations is that you don &apos;t have to give them a lot of in@@ struc@@ tions .
all you have to say is &quot; words &quot; and you know exactly what to do . . ,
here &apos;s another couple of people who test it .
this is our yo@@ un@@ gest a@@ unt ti@@ ll down right now . . .
it turns out he was just going to just just st@@ ack up . . .
so for him , they were just flu@@ c@@ tu@@
this is an inter@@ active tri@@ ck@@ filter man@@ eu@@ vering .
we wanted to develop an edu@@ cational tool for speech . .
this is fe@@ li@@ x . . .
he can bring new characters into the scene by li@@ f@@ ting the si@@ ble bar from the table that this character shows . . . .
this is him going up the sun . .
the sun goes on . .
now he &apos;s pul@@ ling a tra@@ ctor into the scene .
the orange tra@@ ctor .
good work ! yes !
by the way , using the si@@ t@@ ches and she &apos;s going to link them side , and he can inter@@ se@@ ct the characters
his own story . inv@@ ent .
hell@@ o !
it &apos;s a story with obvious end , and he can decide how to evol@@ ve . .
flying cat@@ s . .
the last example i have today showing it to show is a musical sequence cer for live performan@@ ces that we &apos;ve developed recently , and in the si@@ t@@ g@@ y , as a no@@ -@@ bra@@ in@@ er , how leadership fa@@ de
each has four different vari@@ ations ; you can choose what you want to use . . .
and you can put these notes into the sequence that you can put into any pattern . . . .
and you re@@ store them by just holding a ton of a po@@ t@@ able way to sequence a little sequence . a
there are effects that you can transform live , like in rever@@ se and filter .
you connect it with a particular note and it ten@@ ds to hi@@ re it . .
and then more over@@ -@@ super@@ -@@ super@@ -@@ inten@@ ded like p@@ ace and numbers that you &apos;re doing
so let &apos;s see . .
we start in the world &apos;s leaders in two sequen@@ cing , and put them in a line , exp@@ and it , exp@@ and and add a little more of the
now now i i &apos;m &apos;m going going to to add do
a some b@@ stuff ass here . . . .
and i &apos;m now dra@@ wing the fil@@ ters with the gas , so i can ta@@ p the effect live .
i can acceler@@ ate the entire sequence , just by the way , the speed of the p@@ ace in one
and i &apos;m going to move the fil@@ ters right away , and i &apos;m going to push
i can put the sequence up as you walk down .
i and don then &apos;t finally have , to i plan can them throw with all the the pre@@ sequence ce@@ off ding by , going but to it the &apos;s right
impro@@ rate v@@ by ating going ; to they the &apos;re left going . to be a able verse to bar bre@@ . ed , . or shor@@ the
thank you .
so as you can see , my a@@ y@@ my is to develop new human@@ -@@ computer inter@@ faces that just fit to the regular way our brains and bodies work .
and i &apos;ve had time to share with you some of the new design world , and some of the opportunities of what we &apos;re working on in our lab . . .
so the idea that i want to leave with you on the way is that we &apos;re on the ver@@ ge of this new generation of pro@@ fan@@ ity with digital media , bringing information into our world , which is the dem@@ anding
thank you . .
i &apos;m looking forward to talking to you guys .
yes , good after@@ noon .
i &apos;m happy to be there .
yeah , so , what is bio@@ ha@@ cking ?
i first have to get a little bit out , and that &apos;s bio@@ ha@@ cking right now with the modern
i &apos;m studying molecular biology and i &apos;ve just been studying the bio@@ ha@@ cking for a few years now , and i &apos;ve been out of this because i wanted to understand it , and particularly i was trying to understand it , what i learned in
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curi@@ osity , and i wanted to get closer to the matter , like this .
i think that biology in general is now , generally , that biot@@ e@@ ch , it &apos;s all that you &apos;re coun@@ ting to syn@@ thetic biology and so on .
extremely important is now extremely important , and much , much more important will be going to be in the future
there are so intri@@ gu@@ ing things like this all electrical plants on the fol@@ ds . . .
there &apos;s cra@@ ig vent@@ er in the u.s. who is trying to make bio@@ fu@@ r , so it &apos;s gas from al@@ ga@@ e . .
and then , under that , there is also some stuff that has come to be completely in life , which most people don &apos;t realize , is wa@@ ep@@ or@@ ed for , like , wa@@ ep@@ -up enzy@@ mes that allow us to was@@ h up with 40 degrees , are also genetic optimi@@ z@@ ers
and the list is one end@@ less continu@@ ing
and so , from interest to this technology , i just went around the road . a little bit .
now , what &apos;s now ha@@ cking
most people know most of the people that are out of the software field . .
computers ha@@ cking , and it &apos;s going to be in the media so , yeah , the ha@@ ck@@ ers break in some and sound , and so
that and &apos;s that kind software of has sad started for , ha@@ in cking the mr@@ se@@ i vent@@ , h because , it 8@@ &apos;s 0s not , true and that
the what se@@ actually vent@@ it i@@ &apos;s ans actually , starting and to it do &apos;s , also and the what internet &apos;s . actually behind . . .
and it &apos;s about a play@@ ful , creative , original way , a problem . a problem
and the problem , that &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social issue , which is to have a problem of doing things , which simpli@@ fy you , to make any problem , to establi@@ sh a problem , and how can you do that better . . .
and it &apos;s been done , it &apos;s been done with software , but there &apos;s also a whole range of things that have electr@@ on@@ ics that are doing all kinds of things . , you know , there &apos;s a whole bunch of
and now , in terms of biology , and i want to take this metaphor that comes from syn@@ thetic biology , that biology is actually a information science , because , the d.@@ c a code is an abstra@@ ct code , which is , it &apos;s not quite the same as computers , because it &apos;s matter , so it &apos;s matter , so it &apos;s matter , so it
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also program and also code and touch it , like , and that i found that i find incredibly fascinating , and that &apos;s where i just wanted to just go on a lot of a deeper
and that &apos;s actually been taken for 1,000 to eight , these networks .
there &apos;s ha@@ ck@@ ter@@ a do@@ t or@@ g , which is pri@@ mal from swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land with europe and with a co@@ operation in india , but now both people and an active people around the world have now . . people around the world
these are that , actually , a more arti@@ stic enti@@ ty , so there are many artists and philosop@@ her@@ s and collabor@@ ates with scientists who have been dealing with these technologies , and asking questions , and process this crea@@ tively , there &apos;s a museum exhi@@ bi@@ tion and yes , and it &apos;s
but it &apos;s all about finding such a lo@@ aner access to finding a play@@ ful process of a play@@ ful transformation .
and then there &apos;s do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ yourself en@@ ding , which is the equivalent of the ca@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ yourself .
this they is &apos;re from a the little u.s. bit a more network technical , , which and is some actually business more along of there a , for@@ they um &apos;re
where asked you to &apos;re ask going , to yeah be , in they place &apos;ve where asked you questions &apos;re . going to news be . in place dem@@
and from these networks that made the whole popular deal , it &apos;s a scene that i want to do just a portra@@ it of te@@ am@@ ing
here children in , the old left , left all you kinds see of bio@@ people fu@@ go el@@ to s just , sit which around is , a they ha@@ &apos;ve cker set space up , a so lab basically and a look kind at of what
school can , you kind do of when a these private proto@@ school col@@ , s a . non@@ profit . institution , . where everyone . can come . . as a these facili@@ proto@@ ty col@@ , s where .
here &apos;s a group in in@@ don@@ es@@ ia on the left , home , national fi@@ ber , which is , quite a long time . . a lot . .
for a long time , these two networks . .
and that &apos;s in such an arti@@ stic aspe@@ ct of biology , and , yes , electr@@ on@@ ically co@@ st@@ ene , and combin@@ ing that to quite a bit like this
a group from killing ar@@ ar@@ a , i met a while ago , who had a group of people who wanted to be giving out to the public , what they &apos;re learning in the university , and they &apos;ve made such on the street fin@@ ance , and people are trying to explain what is in the city . ,
and i got up on the top of the picture in the middle of the medical museum with an exhi@@ bit on the subject in the medical museum . . . . .
and that is , yes , that &apos;s typically right , young people , but the only thing that actually holds up is this fascin@@ ation of technology . . . .
and what you can do about it , and you can just go through the society with this and ask , &quot; okay , what do you know what you &apos;re going to do , you &apos;ve got an interest in bringing you this way ? &quot; you
so , o@@ .@@ k , to ha@@ ck biology now , you have to
you need , of course , bi@@ ologi@@ cal materials , and you need some tools , and
but , in particular , what you &apos;re looking at under a lab , which is kind of like the de@@ fau@@ lt machines , are sort of expensive , extremely expensive , just for profession@@ als , educ@@ ated acade@@ mi@@ cs with
and our approach was to say , &quot; k , that actually is not to do this . .
this is not necessarily , because every single coffee plan@@ ting is actually a major technology than most of the lab devices , which is really like the most
and then , for example , with this pre@@ mis@@ e , then you &apos;re trying to have brian de@@ g@@ ger in britain , so you &apos;ve taken a minim@@ um print , so you &apos;ve taken a ste@@ am print , a he@@ art@@ print , and you know , it &apos;s been grown , and it &apos;s been grown
so everyone who &apos;s been doing sou@@ p that he has been la@@ ying for too long , even did . . . .
i tried this in my lab to ex@@ tend a little bit , and then i bought this as re@@ mot@@ ely using e@@ bay , and made a little bit of the equivalent of the kind of equivalent , trying to do this kind of a father analysis , trying to do so that ,
now , this should not be a jo@@ ke , but it &apos;s actually a jo@@ ke . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
and here , in the image , you see the lab , in leadership , so that &apos;s such a char@@ ged garage , so that &apos;s such a char@@ ged garage
and this is bio@@ fu@@ cking , which is , in fact , mentioned ha@@ cker space , which is basically a kind of vol@@ k@@ sho@@ f school in molecular biology . . . . . . . . . .
and so , you know , you can see , it &apos;s relatively relatively profound , so that &apos;s
but always , the approach of the approach is that it &apos;s just to be available and acc@@ essi@@ ble . . . . . . . . . . . . .
the first project that we did as an international group of people , as we became so aware of ourselves , o@@ .@@ k
and then the do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ yourself en@@ dea@@ vor came from the fo@@ under@@ s , and he said o@@ .@@ k , we &apos;re now going to have to meet , even real meet , and then have two
and so , it was also about , yes , who@@ o@@ .@@ k , who are we , what do we want to share ? ? sharing . .
and what are our values and what are our target , our basis ? ? ? ?
and then there &apos;s a co@@ -@@ like type of co@@ poli@@ ce . .
and that was quite intui@@ tive , so everyone has just like his wish , his and what moved him , exc@@ use me .
and i think that &apos;s a very good code . . .
and then we have that one , and then we can &apos;t be on that , but that &apos;s what i think is quite good than all of the people are convinced of this . ,
and so we , even i tried think to we bring &apos;re that in back the into bio@@ the ha@@ acade@@ cker mic mr@@ world i , ,
but in it fact &apos;s , kind a of little not further so than concerned the there acade@@ . mic world . . . .
yeah , what kind of projects are we doing this ? ?
a project that i did with the ha@@ ck@@ ter@@ a network in swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land was that we wanted to do what we call a visual pan@@ ent or op@@ tical pin@@ k@@ et ba@@ st@@ le . .
this is when you focus a las@@ er be@@ am on one in the room , you can catch little particles in the air or in the liquid , and then you &apos;re moving in that focus , so that &apos;s what a tra@@ ctor be@@ am principle basically works . . . a tra@@ pp@@ ing principle .
it really works , it &apos;s done in the acade@@ mic trial , and we thought , o@@ .@@ k , we may have taken the board , cut up , cut the l@@ ens , then you have a microscop@@ e that &apos;s going to be able to square around four@@ -@@ fold . in a microscop@@ e , you have a microscop@@ e , it &apos;s about
you see this at the bottom . there
and then we &apos;ve blo@@ cked a stat@@ ue and a bu@@ g , and the burning the las@@ er &apos;s cli@@ ker is just being put out there ,
and that &apos;s not been worked , but we &apos;ve learned a lot about this . .
so , another project that came out of the french group here , it was sli@@ ced , it &apos;s pretty cool .
and he &apos;s like , he &apos;s a kind of brain wave device , so e@@ .@@ e@@ . g or something like that , so he worked with neuro@@ biology , his ni@@ ck@@ name is sam neuro@@ ha@@ ck . his ni@@ ck@@ name
so he &apos;s set up this hel@@ met that &apos;s got this hel@@ met , and in the co@@ operation with the
and then the vis@@ it@@ ors go in the space , sit on this chair , put this hel@@ met up .
then , their bra@@ in@@ waves were measu@@ red , and depen@@ ding on what they thought , or how they thought , are they different lights in the room . .
a pretty sil@@ ly project . . .
another thing that &apos;s done in the united states that has to do with this dad &apos;s re@@ ce@@ der@@ or is that the p@@ .@@ c@@ .@@ r , which is poly@@ mer@@ r ,
so it &apos;s about cutting genes to being able to do the genes , to be able to produce it , to make it visible . .
so if i do that the pro@@ fil@@ ers on the scene , then they go , they ga@@ ther ha@@ ir@@ y , and then they go out there and then they go and do this kind of system , and then they can say , o@@ .@@ k , this ha@@ ar is being heard of this
and the machines that do this , they &apos;re pretty expensive that they buy commercial , which is the che@@ ap@@ est , they go on a thousand euro@@ s
and that &apos;s not the ho@@ b@@ by@@ tan , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also do a lot . . .
so that &apos;s just one use of many that you can do with it .
and they have two ba@@ st@@ ers , and they said , o@@ .@@ k , we &apos;re going to do this very easy and che@@ aper , and then we have a zero source , so more open-@@ source hard@@ ware , electr@@ on@@ ics , these this device set up and are now brought to the market force , and now they &apos;re now the che@@ ap@@ est pro@@ per provi@@ der of these devices . . . in the world
i think that &apos;s kind of seven , i think , or something like
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s still not cheap in a frame@@ work , where it &apos;s now available to it .
so , i think it &apos;s a very , very l@@ eng@@ th ha@@
a project that i just started to build was a time of time .
choice , yes , is like a kind of a kind of a air pressure that &apos;s going to take a sho@@ ot about this , two centi@@ meters or
you invi@@ te it to gold particles , and the gold particles then get into that air pressure tube , and then i sli@@ p it up to the ro@@ bs and then i s@@ nu@@
so the device that you see there doesn &apos;t work .
but that &apos;s my way of getting rid of my prototyp@@ e , which was pretty e@@ er@@ ial , like this , like this , like this , that thing , pul@@ ling out electr@@ on@@ ics , pl@@ um@@ pl@@ ed , and that was the pressure was too high , it
and then i took a no@@ de of a chicken and put that on . .
a seas@@ on of a death ow@@ ner , if you have the power of water , it &apos;s enough to have pressure , i think , like , four to six ni@@
and then you can acceler@@ ate the particles heavy , and then you can put them in the oni@@ on .
and the commercial device costs about five and a half thousand dollars up to something like this , or sac@@ ping fe@@ e around the 50 . . a je@@ t .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically done .
so , it &apos;s the core moment that you &apos;re looking at , right now , the core issues of the scene , and also to increase the information and the understanding of the information , that more people
because , as in the beginning , it &apos;s an incredibly important technology , and most people are actually very little idea about , and no chance of getting really good at getting us . .
because when you read about it , from se@@ ven@@ -@@ min@@ ded liter@@ ature , it &apos;s not the same as you &apos;ve seen it or you &apos;ve seen it . .
and i think technology is becoming more important in our modern societies .
and if you want to get as an in@@ formed citi@@ zen in society , and talk to participa@@ tion , you need access to knowledge and technology . , you need access to knowledge and technology
and you have to do it and understand it , and understand it . . . .
and then it &apos;s going to be under the fin@@ ch@@ est open ben@@ ch
so you &apos;re in the position of citi@@ zen as citizens , and then you have these technologies , and then
and that &apos;s the core concern@@ s of the bio@@ ha@@ ck@@ ers . .
these are the people who have put at least offi@@ cially have the website , the green y@@ .@@ bio@@ -@@ d@@ ot@@ -@@ or@@ g website . .
that &apos;s a fairly substan@@ tial number of people around the world .
and also , interest@@ ingly , they &apos;re also in sou@@ the@@ ast asia . . .
that &apos;s what i believe are there , there are fewer people in them than actually exi@@
so i know about some of you who have not car@@ ed .
and these are just the bio@@ ha@@ cker , the individual people .
and par@@ tly with these ha@@ cker@@ spaces , these places are car@@ ried together . .
and that &apos;s in the beginning .
so , as i said , two-@@ thou@@ sand@@ -@@ two employees , it
and ha@@ cker@@ spaces , the computer ha@@ cker spaces , because the c@@ -@@ base in ber@@ lin was the first , the first 10 hundred and a half thousand .
and this is now a gigan@@ tic network of very good , yes , infrastructure centers that have con@@ fron@@ ted all over the world . . .
and we hope , of course , that we &apos;re going to be a bit of simil@@ ari@@ ties , and also similar to them , so that it &apos;s also
and i would invi@@ te invi@@ tations each time to try and try and get out . .
now , it &apos;s not as simple as it is , but it &apos;s not impossible for you to put some curi@@ osity in it , and you get enough energy into
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yes , hell@@ o .
how do we actually do people ?
this is a question that &apos;s very moved to me as a designer , but also in the field of sci@@ al@@ cies and all sorts of things in the field . an experience .
it &apos;s about how you en@@ able people to be able to en@@ able their inter@@ active media and to use a possible en@@ ding experience to make them more satis@@ fying . satis@@
because i believe that the inter@@ active media inside us , the arch@@ a@@ a@@ an , cognitive models of add@@ res@@ sing , so paradig@@ ms that are mod@@ el@@ ed in our biological memory from very , very long , and that we can actually re@@ vi@@
and this is very amazing because you actually believe that this high-@@ tech technology that you would en@@ coun@@ ter is that you actually put one in the future , but in fact , the future is right in front of us , with our arch@@ a@@ gical
now , what are the arch@@ a@@ an models
i wrote four ni@@ ches on the end , and i &apos;d like to explain to
and arch@@ a@@ an cognitive models , and that is the models that we have been
to these arch@@ a@@ as models , we heard one principle of natural ra@@ ti@@ o to virtu@@ ality . . . .
this is basically very , very mean ,
but i &apos;m going to take you back to the moment , and i &apos;m going to show you that you &apos;re having a natural relationship to the virtual path@@ ology . . .
the second aspe@@ ct is that since we &apos;ve been able to do this arch@@ a@@ a@@ an models , we &apos;re very , very speci@@ ous , even though we &apos;re using a co@@ at language . . .
and the third area , actually , expla@@ ined itself .
we all know that inter@@ active media is based on definition non@@ lin@@ ear , which invol@@ ves the common in@@ action of lin@@ ear@@ ity , and what of course tells us , of course , is we feel the lin@@ ear@@
the fourth thing is that history is for us to be a place of information . .
now , what &apos;s now with the virtual virtu@@ ality is that we &apos;re in the world &apos;s most natural thing
i &apos;d like to prove that to you that you
how many do@@ ors have the house where they live in ?
we &apos;re not going to answer you immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen to you again , and it &apos;s happening happening right now .
they go through the spirit in which they live , and look at how many do@@ ors there are . . a lot
and that &apos;s exactly what they do .
they are virtu@@ es of reality without computers . without computers .
fantastic , right ? ?
and we &apos;re strug@@ gling there to do the virtual reality in our v@@ .@@ r@@ . lab , which is to do that all the time . , we can actually do this
and that one of the wealth that is virtual to virtual practic@@ es , they needed to be a bit@@ ter , because they had nothing what@@ so@@ ever . stuff
they didn &apos;t have the books . .
or they didn &apos;t have a pi@@ ck@@ oli@@ graph@@ y .
they were not a mass medium .
the and only in thing that they particular had level
was , her the head reme@@ . m@@ ber@@
in this head , knowledge was known , and using this virtual ima@@ gery , the in@@ ception , they were now given . . . .
and so it &apos;s so much in us that we &apos;re able to deal with virtu@@ ality as well . . .
and the interesting thing is , if i can make a little trip .
yes , it goes . .
and what &apos;s interesting about this at that time in time was that at that time , human produ@@ cers was at the same
now , if you think about it a little further
what are the media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that there is a change .
but i &apos;ll get to that in a minute . .
so the fundamental tool of information technology has been all around . .
sch@@ am@@ an@@ e@@ en , p@@ rie@@ sts , we call the word g@@ war@@ den , were rele@@ as@@ ing for extra numbers to keep knowledge in
and also , we &apos;re very , very strong in stories . stories
the auth@@ or of the book , the story@@ bis , jon@@ a@@ than got@@ su@@ m , is still a one-@@ hour of a hundred hours with re@@ cep@@ tions of stories . . .
that means for a child who has been able to do the achie@@ ghts of the great age of his life with re@@ cep@@ tac@@ le stories .
now we think our love of stories depen@@ ds on that as a child on the la@@ p of our parents . .
no , no , no , over@@ all .
this goes on to be a lot further in the cultures of pre-@@ history
but to me , in the area of inter@@ active media as an ama@@ ti@@ ous , is that we &apos;ve been de@@ pos@@ ited by our biological memory , the ability to think of non@@ lin@@ ear
i brought you an example of the north american stem of the no@@ ot@@ -@@ indi@@ ans of the no@@
and life lived in the co@@ ast@@ al region of british colum@@ bia .
and as you can see , this is a very in@@ spir@@ ing zone , and you had to kind of navi@@ gate this , from insel from insel to d. to get food . .
and they did it with so-@@ called le@@ ad@@ -@@ land
you may know that already , if you &apos;re a little bit interested , from the austr@@ ali@@ an war@@ in@@ men . . in the
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have le@@ ad@@ -@@ land maps , but they have the kind of geni@@ us son@@ gl@@ ines
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the navi@@ gation and the to@@ po@@ graph@@ y was sha@@ ped above songs of songs . . .
which is , using sub-@@ super@@ -@@ based ran@@ ging .
that is , you &apos;re navi@@ g@@ ating sound and about rhyth@@ m . .
and these sounds and that rhyth@@ m have the ge@@ ology , which repres@@ ented to@@ po@@ graph@@ y of a region , and that , of course , has allowed to make these songs frag@@ mented and to put in a different way and to put them together and go back to the right and again to the front of
why don &apos;t we sing to get to b , from the top of a to
anyway , to navi@@ gate . .
what happened ? ?
this we is &apos;ve what gone happened from , a that hier@@ &apos;s m-@@ the up
natural virus machine . age . . . . . .
and then the machine age and then , the machine age is happening , and it &apos;s happened ,
and what happened is that we &apos;ve shif@@ ted the responsibility for our memor@@ ies and the self-@@ production of our individual memor@@ ies in ex@@ ternal media .
and on the book , and up to the
so we &apos;ve got a little beyond to virtual , a bit beyond , to have a bit of a tran@@ scen@@ dent
virtu@@ ality is suddenly stran@@ ger to us , and
bru@@ ce brown , a very famous design resear@@ cher
let &apos;s make a little res@@ em@@ blan@@ ce . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
from the bird age to the machine age . . .
what has em@@ pa@@ thi@@ bles in our minds and our memor@@ ality ?
then the em@@ ph@@ as@@ is is the out@@ -@@ industrial im@@ pac@@ ts .
and they are actually more likely to be blog@@ ged by the cent@@ u@@ ries
so , instead of reme@@ m@@ br@@ ance , we have standar@@ di@@ zed , wi@@ de@@ per@@ ous , we have a lot of pe@@ tro@@
we &apos;re not producing anymore . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
we have a abstra@@ ct language
we &apos;re not going to make the case in images anymore
we &apos;ve used to think about things lin@@ ear . . . . . .
and we have accep@@ ted the lin@@ ear@@ ity as a law and there
what we left is the &quot; story@@ t@@ eller . &quot; . . . . . .
still , we are very , very re@@
the question is , what &apos;s next ? . . . .
we had this age age , we had the machine
this sounds like this , and it sounds like a science fi@@ ction , and i know it &apos;s a science fi@@ ction . . . .
but these concep@@ ts of cyber@@ age , they bring us to the re@@ discover
there &apos;s virtual lin@@ ear@@ ity , it &apos;s about non@@ lin@@ ear@@ ity , it &apos;s about fro@@ zen . .
i want to explain a little bit about a little bit . . .
there are technical concep@@ ts like the land@@ aug@@ mented reality
so if you look at google glass , for example , then that &apos;s
another example is what &apos;s called virtual reality . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
so , as crazy as i &apos;m talking about , we &apos;re moving into physical forces , and we &apos;re moving into physical worl@@ ds , virtual worl@@ ds , after the h@@ olo@@ c@@ o model . . . . . . .
and others , another example , are ambi@@ di@@ ties , intelligent systems
these are the spaces that can re@@ act to a person . . .
all of this requires the ability to accept the fundamental ability of being a real habit@@ at . .
i &apos;ve actually taught , and i hope the video will bring , a very , very beautiful project , that &apos;s the b@@ ach@@ el@@ ent@@ work of michael bur@@ k , an@@ al ka@@ thr@@ in , j@@ ord@@ is kl@@ l@@ ness , j@@ ord@@ i &apos;s age and j@@ .@@ mor@@ it@@ it .
and the two also last , too . here
you might stand up for a minute , so you can talk to the two through the project . . . . .
and this project , as example , i brought in the arch@@ a@@ e@@ an , cognitive models of add@@ res@@ sing , add@@ ressed .
and this is a game , i have to say .
so what &apos;s going on behind the &quot; well , of course , is a computer game . . .
and if i say computer game game , you probably have very likely to think that any people in your mind will be happy to put around , or that they &apos;re playing with any conc@@ ert in their hand . . . .
anyway , they &apos;re doing it in the inside .
it &apos;s a game on outside .
and that is ti@@ red of trying to discover the outside world , so i re@@ explor@@ ed the real world . .
and this game is conne@@ cting the virtual world , so the data that we produce with the real world . . .
i &apos;m sorry to do so much in a way .
you can tell that much more quickly , there &apos;s more to you . there is more . behind that
and it &apos;s about making a city explor@@ ing by watching where posi@@ tively , i &apos;m looking at where places go to place or negative .
and so i &apos;m getting a very different view of the city , a different impres@@ sion , which i see is negative z@@ ones of a city and a very different kind of thing , a very different virtual map of a very real city . .
and we &apos;re now here to look at this .
ah what you can see here , sorry is another piece of what you &apos;re about to see . . .
of course , this virtual world , of course , habit@@ ats to the walls of our cities
and with a kind of pi@@ ck@@ light , we can make these virtual worl@@ ds visible
so i would like to sum@@ mar@@ ize once my talk , in the sense that the properties and skills that we &apos;ve got from the bird age age , and then went a little bit of the machine age , that with the help of something called &quot; cy@@ ver age , &quot; and that we don &apos;t really have a future that went on in the machine age , that with the help of something called &quot; cy@@ ver age , &quot; and that we don &apos;t really get into
thank you .
yes , i &apos;m really excited to be with you .
i had been asked if this s@@ ack is a s@@ ack , and i &apos;m going to talk instead
it &apos;s not going to
i &apos;m also going to re@@ main the same . on this .
but i &apos;m doing it all the time . . .
yes , children are naturally curious or should be curious , designers are also .
i &apos;m a design of the house , so i &apos;m involved in , of course , in the subject of curi@@ osity and how does the curi@@ osity change , and why are we going to lose curi@@ osity and we &apos;re going to lose it again and have it re@@
this is a whole bunch of things to be used to the actual thing as a form of mind .
now , when profess@@ ors become curious , they &apos;re often going to be standing up in the same
and that &apos;s also what i &apos;d been in the last hal@@
a research se@@ me@@ ster for natural ge@@ ma@@ ster design . .
now you &apos;ll be wonder@@ ing why the whole scan is where the designers are going to be working with as natural , arch@@ a@@ gical dis@@ plays of communication , inter@@ actions
and that &apos;s where i &apos;m only holding one of these little devices up because things are supposed to be more intui@@ tive , always natural , use more , and there &apos;s one you have to look at what &apos;s actually going on for us , what is the user being adap@@ ted
and i &apos;ve been in the field of natural training design , which is the next generation in the process of human computers in the same way that our tools or how the computer of su@@ k@@ c@@ essi@@ ve changes the digital assi@@ stant on the digital assi@@ stant as the computer and how the computer from the computer su@@ k@@ c@@ essi@@ ve is changing
so i started to talk about when , of course or so ,
and maybe again , again , a view of it
why is this happening ? ? that ?
so if we look at our society &apos;s development , we &apos;re now moving from the third to the fourth social generation or more of society . . . . .
so from modern to the computer society .
every society is sha@@ ped by a pri@@ ce-@@ like medium .
at the beginning , the tri@@ b@@ al community is through the language . . .
that is , you &apos;ve found , in order to communicate a common language , you could communicate with each other , and in other areas , cities have created or village , and they &apos;re kind of creating a b@@ al society , and they &apos;re kind of
the primary medium was the language , something very natural , something very natural , something very
you had to learn also , so no child , you know , can be talking about nature , but we &apos;re learning it su@@ k@@ z@@ essi@@ ve
this was done by ancient society and the first form of abstra@@ ction . . .
and that was a huge sh@@ at@@ ter@@ ing , because of course , the living language began to mani@@ fest the kind of living language , which is what flu@@ id and alive , i &apos;m starting and che@@ cking it in stone , i &apos;m able to do it .
as i &apos;ll have che@@ wing , and , of course , i &apos;m going to have a very different kind of record than if it &apos;s a living kind of living . . .
but su@@ k@@ z@@ essi@@ ve then turned this scri@@ pt as primary media , received interven@@ tion . a
and then the next generation we &apos;re actually even more pri@@ mar@@ ily living in today .
this is just the pressure and print scri@@ pt with gu@@ ten@@ berg and
at the time , the mon@@ key , where the du@@ le , c@@ ran@@ us and others have said , are you crazy if the people are beginning to read , the after@@ wards are still going to talk to us , and that &apos;s actually f@@ at@@ al . is actually f@@ at@@ al
and now , in the next generation , and what &apos;s exciting is that we &apos;re just going to get a gener@@ ic shift in a generation of gener@@ a@@ tional change , and we &apos;re really really in this phenomen@@ al phase that we &apos;re doing this . . . .
that conf@@ uses us completely , of course , because we &apos;re seeing on one hand , the new media , the global media , facebook and so on
with total transpar@@ ency , which is the new thinking , what &apos;s bub@@ ble on the old thinking , say , &quot; that &apos;s not the case that the las@@ er &apos;s meat , &quot; no dou@@ ble@@ -@@ like phenomen@@ a , or any of the phenomen@@ a , i want that just to cl@@ ari@@ fy and do
and those two glo@@ ws are just coming together , new and old thinking . . . . . .
and what &apos;s exciting is , if you look at an@@ om@@ as , this new society , this computer society , is very much , very powerful mechanis@@ ms , principles and arch@@ a@@ ic paradig@@ ms from that tri@@ b@@ al society . . .
now , no longer on local level , but on a global scale . .
we &apos;ve understood that the weather is global .
that the theme of ec@@ ology is a global institution .
not if i &apos;m lo@@ cated here , and it &apos;s an e@@ col@@ o@@ gi@@ cally thinking , and it &apos;s less e@@ col@@ o@@ gi@@ cally thinking , it won &apos;t work
that means that , from local village , it &apos;s become a global village with the same principles , of course , as well as intui@@ tive , but also the complete transpar@@ ency .
as you could then , in town in the village , who had what had to do with whom when , this is what happens to me today , through these institutions , through these mobile en@@ clo@@ sur@@ es of
it &apos;s that we know glob@@ ally and ever@@ -@@ growing and ever@@ -@@ growing . . . . . . . .
it &apos;s just as much as it was happening in the
i mean , i just pre@@ tend to see what is it that it &apos;s like to see what is it , what &apos;s the case for us , what is it that &apos;s going to make for us ,
because often people are getting people , they can &apos;t be used to use so that they can hand@@ le it . .
so you have to focus on what &apos;s because , not just do it , it &apos;s going to change it , it &apos;s going to get better . .
and when , of course , when something intui@@ tive , and how do i feel as a form of interven@@ tion and really design it as a form of mind and design it just so you &apos;re an intui@@ tive , so that then you &apos;re intui@@ tive , because then you &apos;re having fun and
you &apos;re enter@@ ing , you know , during the course of the study , the issue of perception and
and of course , that &apos;s what you &apos;re starting to do , and you &apos;re going , okay , now , you know ,
and what about that , actually , in the
so how do we work when we go into rein@@ it ?
and what does that mean , of course , is intui@@ tive , and how do our kan@@ ches affect perception and how does the
because steve jobs said you have to make a strong thing to test pre@@ p it it &apos;s
so you really have to look at the details when i &apos;m kind of using something friend@@ ly or intui@@ tively , which is that he does that in the core . .
and what you see is you have a very , you know , a seven sen@@ ch , which most people think of are now seven , and now we already recognize seven , and we already have a very ne@@ at , and as an exten@@ sion again , it &apos;s going to be the next one , and it &apos;s also going to be the
and seeing how we &apos;re process@@ ing information , how do we take information ?
by all , what &apos;s information ? information ?
information is any difference that makes a difference .
many use the word , knowing it , don &apos;t actually know what it is to
but i have to understand in the heart , understanding when is it going to be energy information to information , when are you going to know how to do things i can , i know how i can also intui@@ tive , or op@@ di@@ fy . . .
and of course , how does this affect the perception
we see this , when i turn things up , i can make them conf@@ used like on the right , where i don &apos;t know what is a s@@ alt and pe@@ pp@@ er or i can design it kind of intui@@ tively . shows . shows , or i can design it kind of intui@@ tively . shows
so a lot of natural , actually , in a po@@ d , but i see sort of directly where is a s@@ alt and pe@@ pp@@ er in there . in there .
and if i tell someone , give me s@@ alt or p@@ is@@ ses , then they &apos;ll be at the right time , where &apos;s in the room . . .
and then on the left , i &apos;m going to be ama@@ tively su@@ cking and hopefully i &apos;m going to realize that there &apos;s no sugar
but also , our perception itself , how they fa@@ vor us ,
so , for example , this perception in
the right circle is actually bigger than the little , although it &apos;s not the case , but it &apos;s a very well-@@ establi@@ shed size , and yet , our perception , depen@@ ding on what context we put in .
does anybody know what that is ?
come on .
fac@@ ator should have been working .
it &apos;s going to be more like my glas@@ ses . .
so it &apos;s the n circle .
a second circle is already beginning to cor@@ rel@@ ate certain times , or associ@@ ate . .
and then , if i &apos;m going to sit down to a half of them , we &apos;re less likely to see one unit , which is , &quot; circle , circle and , we &apos;re looking at one unit , we don &apos;t see anymore three parts , a circle , a
this what is &apos;s something important that for is designers called , high-@@ they level usually psychology have , the or first a
se@@ measure me@@ psychology ster , , which the also great changes design us laws in . perception . , the
designer &apos;s law is near , bl@@ art law of the continu@@ ity and so on .
and it &apos;s often a third day again . .
but that &apos;s an essential part of this , if you want to make things you &apos;re intui@@ tive as well
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting , is the
sounds very b@@ ad@@ ly , but it &apos;s very exciting to be a little bit closer to it . . .
so we got the eyes on the front , and we think we &apos;re seeing from the front up the
that &apos;s wrong .
they first look at the front of the front
nam@@ ely , they tend to be pro@@ mp@@ ing , that they &apos;re seeing something that they recognize , pre@@ cious rock . .
that means we &apos;re only going to see our vision before we see it back in our se@@ he@@ w , to say all the things we get in our se@@ he@@ w pat@@
i have a cognitive feedback , you have what pro@@ j@@ ms is , what you
and then that &apos;s what comes back to that . .
then you go forward , because the back doesn &apos;t take you on the front , and he says , &quot; you don &apos;t see whether what you see is what you want to see . .
and then it goes back to the back , and then it &apos;s going to be late . . .
so , a very exciting process , like some of the things that are happening , and what the milli@@ on-@@ dollar areas are happening . in the way that
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s going to know this picture .
and that &apos;s what happens exactly what i just described .
now everyone from this pattern is trying to dete@@ ct something . . .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s going to see it . .
does somebody see a particular thing ?
a d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er , right .
if i saw that , that &apos;s because there &apos;s a d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er inside there , you know that .
you &apos;ll never forget it , because i &apos;m showing you where the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er is .
now you see the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er .
and on , you &apos;re always going to see him . .
now , i actually suggest@@ ed you now that they &apos;re not able to recognize any basic photo@@ life in it , but i &apos;ve got them con@@ condi@@ tion@@ ing within a few years , and i &apos;ve got con@@ condi@@ tion@@ -@@ shif@@ ting
and this is the proje@@ ction of vision , feedback , vision .
now i know now , now i &apos;m going to pro@@ of , i &apos;m seeing the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er
i see the d@@ al@@ mati@@ an . .
so , very exciting processes that then you can do that , yeah , gra@@ y is actually not , but here in this red force was actually going to be dis@@ played by this . .
does anybody know what about three seconds ?
long , yes . .
this is our present .
so it &apos;s always interesting to know that as a designer .
if i know something , three seconds , i kind of take out of the moment into the past , i can actually get straight in the past , i can &apos;t get a lot of time right now where i &apos;m always doing it with three seconds .
it &apos;s got to process that as the present .
and then it goes to the past , and so i can really help very elegan@@ t and te@@ ily for example , for example , when i know that phenomenon . when i know that
what does five thousand seconds take away ? ?
yes , milli@@ seconds .
and also a very exciting phenomenon
that &apos;s the ti@@ ming of time in fall . . .
that means that , if you know that , you know who you &apos;re going to take you to know who you &apos;re going to take you on for long , because i
and that six &apos;s million the seconds ti@@ , ming also of a most very per@@ exciting cep@@
phenomenon tions . that we . have . . . . .
that &apos;s the first impres@@ sion that happens in a rapi@@ dly fast speed as we percei@@ ve things . .
and as we see things as we see , and how we rel@@ ate to our environment , so that we can en@@ coun@@ ter that . . . . .
now , the shape not only , not only , rel@@ u@@ ct@@ ability and cognitive process@@ ing or cognitive process@@ ing , but pri@@ mar@@ ily , pri@@ mar@@ ily with human object . . . . . .
so , how does a human being be dis@@ played
there &apos;s a product of product , the practical fun@@ ctions , so mal@@ ware , as form@@ ig@@ nan@@ al parts , are the kind of unique things .
there are sig@@ ns of fun@@ ctions where i know exactly where to reach . . .
but there are also symbo@@ lic fun@@ ctions , so why have you just given up for a little bit of a sle@@ e@@ per where there &apos;s har@@ dly any things in it , so that &apos;s hor@@ ror su@@ mm@@ ers of money ,
we &apos;re more symbo@@ lic on the most symbo@@ lic , which we also engage as a cre@@ ator of course . . . .
to my actual point , of course , of course , of natural buil@@ ds and the issue , which is , of course ,
us@@ able means how can i achieve a goal or a goal , or how can an user be able to achieve in a certain operating context , effectively , efficient and satis@@ fying a goal . .
so it &apos;s more like the nor@@ m .
how do i make use of this ? that i could use
i can do this directly or i need it by hand book or i need to call it a random school
and less us@@ eless or user friend@@ ly . . .
that i &apos;m only doing it , and i make beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s
you have to understand that . .
and then , if you think of the software that we just saw , it &apos;s going to be able to understand why nine and ei@@ gh@@ ty percent of our current software was so intui@@ tive or not using on the basis of deci@@ ding the i@@ .@@ q@@ . , the i@@ .@@ q@@ . in many areas or i@@ -@@ cell , even though
so , the reason that &apos;s intui@@ tive is not only a pro@@ per economic factor , the primary energy factor , if i want to make a tool of people &apos;s tools . . . . .
why ?
because normally , we &apos;re using these new kinds of us@@ ability , so the natural user cells , for example , are at least five times faster at our dest@@ ination . .
you have to imagine that , if you &apos;re doing something of the classi@@ c so@@ b@@ tr@@ oth , five hours , and you have to have an hour of natural software just for an hour . type of natural software . a new
now , you don &apos;t think you can probably get home for four hours , but your emplo@@ yers or someone will come to a little bit like he &apos;s enga@@ ged with the four hours
but i want to say that for us , of course , it &apos;s a very smart performance rise , we &apos;re also making certain things to do .
so if we then give ourselves back into the field of software , so the first song inter@@ faces that were very abstra@@ ct was where you took months to deal with these systems . . . .
and then the next ones that already came to ne@@ ne@@ m neu@@ ral model or mental models like the software of space , you have worked , you have an idea of something that &apos;s metaphor , the metaphor of the des@@ k@@ top , to make the computer us@@ able . .
so and no this more has zer@@ been os much and better sing@@ , ing of , course or , kr@@ but yp@@ it tic
&apos;s co@@ much des better , than is that a . metaphor . a lot . better than . that .
the so next i generation used of to the form graphic a user lot reser@@ of d@@ times der as is
a working cre@@ a ator lot as more the with result behavior . . than . that .
this is a paradig@@ m shift . .
and so suddenly , i think that this looks always un@@ important to success , the us@@ ability is a poin@@ ting piece . .
and if i take one step further into this natural user inter@@ faces , where i &apos;m a voice , language , playing by gest@@ ure , gest@@ ure , gest@@ ures and no longer your mouse and cur@@ sor , i &apos;m still quick@@ er and
but this is also leading to the point , but when are things really intui@@ tive ? ?
if you become more intui@@ tive , and then i have to pa@@ ste my little friend here , and see , which is that coming from the point of cognitive control , when is it really something that &apos;s so intui@@ tive ?
and that &apos;s kind of a bit intui@@ tive to us as humans , when i have to think about it a little bit about it .
so he doesn &apos;t seem to think like he &apos;s going to make it quite easy , but it &apos;s a bit of
the less i think about it , the more intui@@ tive it is . . .
and what does that mean for the designers ?
so , if we look at that , we can actually trans@@ late that we can trans@@ late exi@@ sting cra@@ f@@ ting from one to something else , the metaphor , i can make this as
that is , i can just trans@@ fer a pre@@ cognitive human action model to software , and make the software more use more effectively . in the way that
but , of course , the question is , what is the intui@@ tive action of us , the human people , and now i &apos;ve been telling it to me
this is what the o@@ si@@ mir model is .
it &apos;s used by all of us and o@@ sten@@ si@@ zes , and it &apos;s an ac@@ r@@ ony@@ m , and it &apos;s for com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sive
and that makes each of you all the time , but he does not consci@@ ously make it consci@@ ously and in part , as intui@@ tive as you can . instin@@ c@@ tively
the model is already going on in the wom@@ b , and is inter@@ cul@@ tur@@ ally , so it works in young and old , and it &apos;s going to work by us all the time without knowing that this model is there . , the world &apos;s available
it &apos;s been found by about 50 to 17 times a thousand times by activity , so you &apos;ve figured out that there &apos;s less a lot of fra@@ gi@@ le being done on the day . . . .
now i can now ori@@ ent this mental action model , sel@@ ec@@ ting , in@@ centi@@ ves , trans@@ fer , trans@@ fer
and through this kind of trans@@ mission , similar to the metaphor of the des@@ k@@ top , but not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a to@@ ating pattern , a cra@@ f@@ ting principle .
and this is on a higher gra@@ il of the user &apos;s learning as a trans@@ mission of classi@@ c metaphor , which is the des@@ k@@ top . one . .
and so , for example , if i go through this , for example , in my for@@ ec@@ as , sel@@ ec@@ tively , as op@@ posed to , in@@ spe@@ ct , to me , to me , it &apos;s all about me , looking at me , and i &apos;m sure , it &apos;s tran@@ fer@@ por@@ ating , and i can &apos;t put that in there or buy somebody
then i can trans@@ fer that whole . .
i &apos;m trying to do this in a way that i
everybody &apos;s been eating . &apos;@@ clock .
and i think , now , inter@@ acting with the object , i kind of zo@@ om out , zo@@ om out on it ,
i &apos;ll get the entire over@@ all look , can be fil@@ ter@@ ing up to filter this , and can just say , show me the whole thing
and i have a interface , which is so more intui@@ tive and much more intui@@ tive .
because i can control things like the bits , and touch , and they come up to me is a lot more natural than than if you have hier@@ arch@@ ically organized web@@ sites or other mechanis@@ ms of mechanis@@ ms to make things available . . a way of doing these things . . , or
now , imagination is more and more el@@ -@@ ti@@ red , and i want to end with that note , a one and again , to give the hin@@ es , including the evidence , even the designers have to think differently , to get to new solutions , and
i want to help you a specific aspe@@ ct of curi@@ osity . . . .
the first thing that if you get up to a child as a child , it &apos;s that they care about what dri@@ ves sh@@ it they have , yeah ? and if their parents have allowed them to play more or less in the th@@ us@@ her , the more , they become their curi@@ osity of course . . , they &apos;re going to be er@@ adi@@ cated of
and curi@@ osity doesn &apos;t learn . .
so , they &apos;re all about these who are and curious , actually , people who have a property that you cannot learn .
i &apos;m now about to make all this entire environmental debate , worl@@ d-@@ scale ro@@ me , to make it work in quality . . . . . .
and there &apos;s a central thing to do .
and it depen@@ ds on phosp@@ hor@@ us . .
give pe@@ e a opportunity .
they give you a number of more of the phosp@@ hor@@ us , and they &apos;re going to take about two gra@@ m of phosp@@ hor@@ us and they have to take two gra@@ m of phosp@@
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
they cannot store energy . . . .
they can &apos;t have b@@ ones . . .
we could only dist@@ ingu@@ ish as am@@ or@@ ro@@ es m@@ oll@@ us@@ ks through the world &apos;s ocean . . .
if indeed we take our phosp@@ hor@@ us and we go out . . .
now , ama@@ z@@ ingly , we &apos;re talking about something here , which is actually what we &apos;re doing , but not that much
because everyone talks about energy , but nobody is talking about phosp@@ hor@@ us . . .
the phosp@@ hor@@ us problem is much more critical .
we dep@@ end on two countries . .
we &apos;ve only got phosp@@ hor@@ us , and already has already become more ur@@ gen@@ cy , in the world , in the world , in a lot more ur@@ bi@@ ti@@ zing to the environment than being used in all
in the last two decades alone , there are five thousand tons of ur@@ ani@@ um on our fields in germany . . . .
and we take that all up . .
leu@@ ke@@ mi@@ es in children . .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less sk@@ ill@@ ful .
so , for example , sh@@ it@@ ter@@ ing the environment , less of the
sh@@ ine the environment , make less waste . .
sh@@ ine the environment , less energy . .
that &apos;s not a protection .
so this is like i said , look , your kid , just three times as much as
that &apos;s just a little bit less destruction .
if we think about the no@@ x to the ba@@ g , our whole world will be used to later , or later a pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful . . . .
that &apos;s why the wei@@ gh@@ ty of thinking . . . .
and the most important thing is looking at the soil , is to look at the ground
in the soil , over 6@@ 0-@@ percent of the carbon is stor@@ ed .
we &apos;re building ma@@ ize on the moment , and losing between 11 and three-@@ po@@ und pounds per he@@ ct@@ are , or at the square meter , or using it . in the square meter , or using it
that means we &apos;re losing a five-@@ minute , more re@@ formed , more re@@ formed .
we can look at the war of course the land problem . .
and all you do is wra@@ p pac@@ ka@@ ge or content .
for example , in the house of houses , by two percent of the land@@ times of the land@@ ing rain@@ cape . . . .
and so because that we &apos;s &apos;re what older they , &apos;re the all wind in will the be
order bigger of . the day . . . . . .
yes ?
a baby takes about six@@ -@@ and-@@ hour wind . .
we could of course reduce this , about 10 percent , but what does it do ?
this is going to be compared to in a second .
this is completely tri@@ vi@@ al .
so here the &apos;s question one is of , the how evidence do that we men deal are with not
these pig@@ di@@ s vel@@ . ing ? . ? . . .
let me tell you . . .
because the phosp@@ hor@@ us is actually given to the pi@@ g parts of the fe@@ a@@ thers . .
people on ur@@ in@@ ine . . . .
yeah .
so men don &apos;t have a pi@@ g .
because that &apos;s evidence , right ? .
tradition@@ ally , we think of the environmental debate , we &apos;re too many people in the world . too . . .
and when you &apos;re told people , when you &apos;re experi@@ en@@ cing it , if you &apos;re told that it &apos;s better , you &apos;re not there , then you &apos;re going to be re@@ fu@@ ge@@ ous and ho@@
and so someone like al gore , one of our great hero@@ es , there &apos;s nothing important to stabili@@ ze the human population . . ris@@ ing .
in israel , you say , if you &apos;re reading a human life , you &apos;re going to eat
here it says , the more you get , the better you are . . . .
yeah .
the first question is , are we truly too many ? ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , the ants are about four times more than we humans are
i could also take an ar@@ ter@@ y , but in the states , nobody would be seen in that same remote , although they &apos;re vege@@ t@@
that means that ants sp@@ inning much more than us
and because they &apos;re working physi@@ cally much harder than we do , and because only three or six months of life , they will be de@@ gra@@ ded in their weight , in the energy consum@@ ers
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re stupid , yeah ? ? . .
and where you &apos;re looking at how far we were going to get away from what we really wanted to get , and could we be , and how sad we are at all on earth , can you be able to see that , for example , what sad we are is a program , until 20 , 30 , you want to
you can only be cli@@ ans@@ man if you don &apos;t exist , yeah ? ?
the only way . .
have you ever seen a cli@@ ent tree ? ?
yes ? ?
one ? ? one
that means our whole intelligence means that we want to be a trees , right ? . . .
yes ? ?
no tree is carbon tra@@ l . . . .
th@@ ank@@ fully , yes ?
there &apos;s no over@@ population problem in trees . .
there are still si@@ x-@@ up billion trees alone in the ama@@ zon .
they &apos;ve heard about trees from trees that have been heard of trees
that means that all of our intelligence means we want to be a trees as trees . .
and where you see , even as de@@ meter , the stri@@ king bio@@ -@@ u@@ ps , you cannot do that , you cannot go back and forth our own me@@ tab@@ oli@@ c products .
we lose three million tons each year that really would have to go back to circu@@ lation . . .
and that &apos;s where we are too many .
just about it . .
that &apos;s what we feel so a@@ f@@ ten@@ ly on earth , that we &apos;re saying . there &apos;s no organic farm , no bi@@ ol@@ and , no natural re@@ plac@@ ement , and how you all are , that allow our own ex@@ cre@@ ment to go back . . . . .
isn so &apos;t we that are sad too ? many
. ? . ? . ?
it &apos;s safe to be less dama@@ ging , to be less dama@@ ging , which is oil
but where are we practical ? ?
we &apos;re trying to mini@@ mi@@ ze our environmental foot@@ print , but it &apos;s about having a big foot@@ print that &apos;s useful . . .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it &apos;s about the environment , the highest , not to be there , right ? ? ? ? ? ?
nu@@ l@@ le@@ mis@@ sions , yes
you can only have zer@@ l@@ le@@ mis@@ sions , if you &apos;re
even if you sho@@ ot yourself , you would have degrees . . .
so you can &apos;t fix this .
we can do it differently .
we can re@@ gain our nutri@@ ents .
we &apos;re doing it in brazil , agriculture in where we &apos;re re@@ moving the nutri@@
in fact , we can go back to that kind of environment in the way
we do this in china for example , where we take directly the waste of the di@@ stances .
in china , a post-@@ la@@ ke , you know , hon@@ ey here , you know , yes ? ? ?
and in our western world we were always jo@@ m@@ bled , our nutri@@ ents . .
that means that the entire western civili@@ on story dra@@ ws out that the city is always just taken , but the farmers never had been given back .
and so the cities would grow more and more because the farmers went into the cities and the cities had to go and continue to get their nutri@@ ents . .
so all western rich is always exp@@ anding , until they &apos;ve done the infrastructure and then they &apos;re im@@ plo@@ cked . . .
yes ? ?
in china it was different .
they &apos;ve been able to get a fif@@ -@@ year civilization on five thousand years because you &apos;ve been able to get the nutri@@ ents
even today , if you &apos;re invited to eat in china , you expect to stay like you stay , until you &apos;re looking for the toi@@ let . .
because it &apos;s un@@ friend@@ ly to go and take the nutri@@ ents . .
they have la@@ id them to eat them , not to the nutri@@ ent core .
that means you can see the web in the web , you can get the nutri@@
it &apos;s actually nice , if you do , so agriculture makes , bi@@ og@@ as , in a he@@ ct@@ are country with five thousand people in fa@@ vel@@ as , can produce a si@@ st@@ y-@@ foot , roughly a hundred hundred dollars , and the production that is available for the chicken to grow chicken and pig@@ s and vege@@ tables and a fish . . . . . . . .
and the great thing about this is that the rate of crimin@@ al rate goes back in the fa@@ vel@@ as about nine percent .
so we don &apos;t need to control people , just to be very little . . . . .
we can support them to be good .
that &apos;s , of course , high-@@ tech agriculture , but the plants have self-@@ interest .
the by@@ product is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed to be designed by design to make a far@@ mer just to produce it
so , that means that the ju@@ ice mar@@ ks
and none of these asse@@ ts , we now have over a hundred to fif@@ ths in the last two decades , not of these asse@@ ts , has never been organized . . s@@ ab@@ ling .
you could put a li@@ ter al@@ li@@ l in the house so easily that &apos;s going to be ru@@ ined over years . . .
there &apos;s no difference .
that means we don &apos;t have to control people , just to be very little . . . .
we can support them to be good .
that means we have to get phosp@@ hor@@ us back .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want to do , you go up , in germany , to be best in frank@@ ri@@ t . . .
unfortunately , the &apos;t obvious thing , but maybe you can help the au@@ ter@@ ster to help us get a little
because the fro@@ zen sands may best re@@ store the phosp@@ hor@@ us . . . .
and it has to go back .
we &apos;re seeing that we really cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ ze phosp@@ hor@@
and we see it really does . . .
we &apos;ve now been working in h@@ oll@@ and for three years . . .
the industry has led to the du@@ tch government , which is to re@@ f@@ use phosp@@ hor@@ us to re@@ war@@ se
but we need that in total .
you know , there are two countries control control of the world &apos;s phosp@@ hor@@ us reser@@ ves . . . .
there is op@@ e@@ c a bunch of or@@ phan@@ ies . . .
that &apos;s si@@ x-@@ day countries who control 40 percent of the oil supply . . . . .
and the oil will replace that by other energy re@@ turns . .
but you cannot replace phosp@@ hor@@ us . . .
that &apos;s not about making exi@@ sting the exi@@ sting of the exi@@ sting , it &apos;s about making something right . .
and first of all , first of all , is what the right thing
that means that it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency
in h@@ oll@@ and , of course , you have this easier because in h@@ oll@@ and , the land is built in
yes ? ?
imagine if you &apos;re sad , for example , your wife &apos;s sad , if you car@@ ed at it , and you come
completely in@@ efficient .
but really , very effective , yes
or take a li@@ p pen .
a woman in germany , about six com@@ ma three pounds of her life . . . . .
so here .
that &apos;s not exactly right , scienti@@ fically , because we don &apos;t know how much away is being cool . . . . is
but a li@@ p pen , even at that light trick , can i tell you , is completely in@@ efficient , but really effective , yes ?
a thing that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
that &apos;s not the point of resources , it &apos;s effective . . .
so to ask , what is the right ? ? .
not to burn the gl@@ ori@@ et , even more quickly , and it &apos;s going to shu@@ t down the whole material and to lose it in the ra@@ m@@ ble plant , but first of all , to ask how you do the
imagine mo@@ z@@ art efficient . .
yes ?
when i get them to dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a pi@@ ck@@ le with a mis@@ ery taste and a glass of water . . . . .
wonderful that , &apos;s &quot;
efficient is . it
all that is beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love in love with somebody else ?
yes ?
that means that all that matters in life is not to save , to avoid . . . .
all the environmental debate .
we tell people , oh , you haven &apos;t got an e@@ ye@@ -@@ the-@@ green awareness . .
no , throw it away is just the right thing , right ? ?
at every point , you throw away from , yes , you &apos;ll make life . .
but the wrong things .
if you throw away the wrong things , you have a waste problem .
as we think about the north . . .
there &apos;s every foot@@ print that everybody has pro@@ ven .
if you walk , yes , everybody &apos;s foot@@ print , the surface , they burn
because the soil is going to die , and the wind , and the water , you load the soil .
but if you &apos;re in it@@ al@@ y , everyone means that the water rema@@ ins in the me@@ a@@ dow for longer .
so , it &apos;s about making a big foot@@ print that &apos;s going to get a we@@ t@@ land .
not de@@ bt management . .
we say in germany . sustain@@ ability
yes ?
but if i ask you , how do you deal with your wife
what do you say then ?
sustainable .
i &apos;m saying , kind of , very poor , right ? ?
that &apos;s the minim@@ um . is the
so not save , they &apos;re missing , avo@@ i@@ dance . .
any waste is nutri@@ ent . waste .
and it &apos;s a l@@ ust when you see in it@@ al@@ y , like the people in the high bo@@ w , blo@@ wing off co@@ ke . .
because you know , it &apos;s a fun process . .
it &apos;s a re@@ treat of re@@ treat , right ? ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the real design , please .
for example , we &apos;ve developed an ice scan@@ l , which is liquid temperature . liquid . .
they can throw them away from where they go
in two hours , they &apos;re going to be lo@@ cked everywhere . .
and it con@@ tains see@@ ds of rare plants , so that they can contribu@@ te through the bio@@ diversity of bio@@ diversity . .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less p@@ est . . . .
so , two cir@@ cles . .
not to be sure is not supposed to be com@@ po@@
and a television machine or a wash@@ ing machine that you &apos;re just using , you don &apos;t use it . consum@@
the things that miss , as you have , how to get the h@@ es@@ it@@ u@@ ous , how the he@@ el , like the guar@@ d@@ ons , have to be like the car , they need to be in biological systems . .
the things that are just used are going into technical systems
but today we &apos;re just talking about biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the s@@ ne@@ ak@@ er , yeah ? ?
in general , it &apos;s not for the company called pu@@ ma by don@@ cy , for that they &apos;re helping this to be
because we don &apos;t do the things better than that . .
yes ?
so if i invi@@ te you to the food and say , it &apos;s free of g@@ rief , it doesn &apos;t help anything .
no , we &apos;re stuck what &apos;s inside .
positive . .
so not like de@@ to@@ x . .
not po@@ is@@ on@@ ous in the heart . .
it &apos;s all in the stuff that &apos;s useful .
these are the first shoes you can put on the ca@@ val@@ ali@@ an &apos;s nest at the pe@@ de@@ stri@@ an nest and go to biological cy@@ cles , right ? ? ? ?
everything is com@@ po@@ ble about it . com@@ po@@
and if we succe@@ ed , of course , we can engineer , for a ni@@ ke , for ke@@ a , for den@@ -@@ and mau@@ ri@@ tz , and all the tex@@ tile industry . .
and that &apos;s half of all of the river &apos;s water problem in the world that are caused
and so , i &apos;m helping you with , ask for the people
hey , pu@@ ma , does you really care ? ?
because already they did it twice the head board . . . .
and i &apos;m not sure you &apos;re really going to get there . .
so help me do a little bit .
it &apos;s happening . .
yeah .
that &apos;s what &apos;s been pres@@ ented just about .
this is . .
we can do things now that , if you mer@@ ge , if you &apos;re mer@@ ged , you can go into biological cir@@ cles . cir@@ cular cir@@ cles .
we have the same technology . cycle
there is this direct back@@ ward system . . .
this is the first e@@ col@@ o@@ gical back@@ pack , actually , that made it into the circu@@ lation . . .
so again , in every store you can get things back . .
if you come to that , right ?
do you remember the bla@@ de again ?
if it is right now , the tr@@ ash
all where right people , get there to are get
these money wind . r@@ um . ,
and there &apos;s no way in the po@@ dium , but you also in the landscape , right ? ?
if we change the plasti@@ cs so that it can go into biological systems , if we change water stor@@ es , inside the water , that they can be cro@@ pl@@ ed back on cell stor@@ es , then they can plant a baby in israel or in tun@@ isi@@ a . a baby in israel or
yes ?
just when you &apos;re taking these bla@@ de , it &apos;s s@@ wee@@ ping , ster@@ ili@@ zing , and the pul@@ se pi@@ cks to plant trees . .
so the baby is carbon positive for all life , from the beginning . from the beginning
so , we don &apos;t need a cli@@ gue , we can be the climate positive . . .
it &apos;s sort of a sig@@ ned of a behavior .
yeah , so . .
yes ?
we can do that .
we i can started re-@@ a rein@@ fo@@ vent unded anything
institute . . . . . .
now , by the mean@@ time , there are lots of people who are
there &apos;s another one that gives you a promise to cra@@ d@@ le cra@@ d@@ le , where everyone can do it . .
so no longer saving , en@@ ab@@ ling , reduce , no de@@ ce@@ dation , but intelligent waste . waste . waste . . .
does it be the curious ?
thank you .
the work of interpre@@ ting . .
music as a language .
in the descri@@ ption , i wrote in the descri@@ ption , that i as interpre@@ t , as a transl@@ ator , is in the english word . hidden . . .
interpre@@ t is trans@@ lat@@ ors of the written music in clinical music . .
that you don &apos;t just have to be just a word of word , and you need to understand the text in a different language , but you need to understand the deep sense of words and what it &apos;s called , you know , to understand it , to have a meaning@@ ful trans@@ lation , everybody who
already , trans@@ late into english , it can require knowledge , once you get to the di@@ ration or even about poetry . , if you &apos;re on poetry , or even
but it &apos;s a whole stran@@ ger of stor@@ es , but what we do with our music
in fact , in a piece of music , i first did the slide notes . .
you know , the com@@ pos@@ er has written everything in the notes , which he set up to be . . .
in fact , the notes are very va@@ gue and accu@@ rate .
these notes are roughly the same or immedi@@ ate , like a verb@@ al , if it &apos;s very , very appar@@ ent , descri@@ ption of a landscape .
because in this verb@@ al scale , the fra@@ ming of flo@@ wers is not har@@ sh , the degree of the flo@@ ats is not to listen , not to listen to the sea &apos;s wind , not to feel . .
that means that interpre@@ t needs to interpre@@ t this un@@ lo@@ cked idea of the emergen@@ ce of the emergen@@ ce of a comm@@ and of trust in another , which is audi@@ audi@@ es , con@@ cre@@ te , non@@ verb@@
today i want to share with you what i would do to trans@@ late musical use , which is , interpre@@ ting
so basically a trans@@ lation of trans@@ lation . . .
so i pre@@ fer to do it the other thing as well , because if i had to trans@@ late it into english , it would be equ@@ ally significant to me with trans@@ lation of trans@@ lation . . .
so , the music for me is kind of like the spo@@ ken language , so much like
the notes are the tex@@ ture of the letters of the letters of a scri@@ pt
so it &apos;s not enough to read just the notes , and to press the keys on the piano or the right location on a viol@@ in@@ ore@@ side .
and the that point was of just letters the you letters can you see learned is
to when paint you . can get . language to . it .
so for the learning process , you need the music process as much as the spo@@ ken language . as the spo@@ ken
and then , there &apos;s also incre@@ ments , whether you &apos;re learning it for the so-@@ used , only passi@@ vely speaking , or you can also talk to the musical mother . , to the musical language physi@@ cians . . . as
the work of interpre@@ ted is the same way of a theater director . , as a theater .
after you &apos;ve cho@@ sen a piece of play , because you &apos;re excited to leave you for the first time , the emergen@@ ce of the com@@ position .
you collect information on the se@@ min@@ al liter@@ ature . .
you read in the letters , they che@@ at , or no@@ ti@@ fy , or whether it &apos;s words , thoughts from com@@ pos@@
you study the works that he &apos;s com@@ pos@@ ed before and after
you can compare them to that .
the how op@@ did tions he it feel
&apos;s ? writing . ?
how did its circum@@ stances , like society and politics ? ? how were its living circum@@
all of this interest . .
you &apos;re thinking of that time in this time , and you &apos;re reading con@@ temporary images
over time , you also have a rich knowledge of knowledge that you &apos;re talking about , you know , that you &apos;re going to take more people into it and feel it in it and feel it . in it . . . in it and
the com@@ pos@@ er is increasingly going to be more and more to the friend
his desire to write , to write the piece , becomes increasingly and more and more about
now , as a notes , everything else is an ex@@ act record of the cont@@ ents of the com@@ pos@@ er , but just a frame@@ work , i turn this frame@@ work to make it come back and forth . . .
i &apos;ll say to my own words , which could be written between this frame@@ work . .
i &apos;m playing the way that those notes might have to be .
now for me , for the com@@ pos@@ er at the time , what you might now have for him now . . . .
every note , every phr@@ ase , gets a sense of it , because i feel it myself because it &apos;s my favorite way of doing it . for
and it &apos;s got to be now now now being inter@@ person@@ ated , otherwise i can &apos;t per@@ su@@ ade my audi@@ ences to
it &apos;s always a very happy conc@@ ert , when i can have the experience that i &apos;ve worked for so long for so long as to experience how new to experience . . . .
and i as &apos;ve you become experience a a day happy older new , day growing , seas@@ you ons get , to changing re@@ the fresh gra@@ , des and at you night see , , in with a the conc@@ same ert ritu@@ hall als , of it
life just , takes the longer break@@ that fast sound , comes the back best back thing to i home do when is it again comes again home again . and again . . . on a . long time . . .
i take that breath of the audience consci@@ ously or un@@ consci@@ ously . . .
all of this affected me and all this , what i do is the experience of
and so , quite wonderful , if i stand on the stage with a du@@ m@@ b partner on the stage , and we have the same
then the same thing happens in a good , per@@ -@@ appropriate conversation . .
you bring in a new idea in and you &apos;ll be ans@@ wer@@ ed in a way that is going to
it &apos;s exciting because then things that we haven &apos;t pro@@ fo@@ ked and what you can &apos;t tell .
it &apos;s great fun to make music in this way , and you have experience as the audience as the audience communic@@ ates alive . .
so each conc@@ ert is a different conc@@ ert . is a conc@@
i i &apos;ll &apos;m never not play going the to way play i this &apos;m as going in
to 20 play years . . in . that moment . . .
i &apos;m going to have more life experience than it is today and i &apos;m going to have a lot more color of music on the subject of music than we have today .
sure , i &apos;ll get some color heads out of it , but get new ones . . . . .
have a nice example of that . . . . .
it was on a piano cen@@ sor for music students at my belo@@ ved old teachers , professor j@@ ack sl@@ ack , a fam@@ in bee@@ tho@@ ven speci@@ alist , con@@ cer@@ ting , and lon@@ -@@ long professor of music high school at stu@@ tt@@ k@@ art . .
unfortunately , i was a lot too young so that he was already an emer@@ gent when i finally started to study .
but i was lucky enough to meet him very early , with three ten years , and i was on his clas@@ ses at the clas@@ ses . . at my time . . .
i was then 17 when i was taking one of his clas@@ ses again , and i was playing the last of the room , and i was playing the last of the bal@@ let con@@
he asked me what the en@@ ligh@@ su@@ ment of this bal@@ lo@@ de was for me . .
this is a tra@@ de-@@ off part . .
and in my ju@@ ven@@ i@@ a , i said expec@@ tation
and then he was cr@@ us@@ hing , and he
that because it &apos;s it was what means about the
that six age she . of is the reme@@
. game m@@ should ber@@ . be ed
well , with se@@ ven@@ ten you &apos;ve had dreams , but none of them are not a significant
i &apos;m going to play back the piece of every few years , and i &apos;ve turned it back to me today , although not a single note
every time it &apos;s exciting , because i &apos;m going to read something new again .
an example of a whole new area : mon@@ et has pain@@ ted the se@@ ero@@ gen again . . .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but different days of time , different light . . .
he &apos;s not trans@@ late the ni@@ vel@@ ant , like he saw , the way she saw it was to work on this moment .
his personal cre@@ ations of the se@@ dan . .
the x-@@ time prin@@ ting of a piece is that compar@@ able . . . . . .
now , i &apos;m already older to this ch@@ op@@ in with two-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half years when he wrote the
it &apos;s only been a nin@@ e-@@ day years . .
and i &apos;m important to look at notes again , even if i mean to be able to turn it off . . .
to keep the law , directly , with the com@@ pos@@ er . .
because the notes are the only connections directly to him .
most of all , when he &apos;s gone
now , how do you start talking about music &apos;s language ?
i said yes , it takes the same as long as the spo@@ ken language . . .
often you the learn music virtu@@ shop ally is a so word much , that
before you you &apos;re just learning speak to one read word the . notes
you learn to find the notes to come to the notes . . .
if all the fing@@ ers in time and right look like it &apos;s going , they come out , they &apos;ll come out together like music . . . . . . .
when the failed hits , the students get the next hard piece . . . . . .
and interpretation is not talking about interpretation in the early days .
all right , there it goes back to the fore@@ st@@ o , which is a quick piece .
len@@ to , slowly .
and l@@ oud and exc@@ use , f and b , etc . . . .
you know that most of you here .
but even if you put that out , you still have a little bit more technical . .
and yet , it &apos;s always not interpretation .
i wonder . .
i wonder that you often fear something very fundamental . .
because to make music on the instrument that &apos;s got to be present with your musical and feeling before . . . .
that &apos;s sing@@ ing .
a child who didn &apos;t learn sing@@ ing because it didn &apos;t have the parents , it will not be done by itself . . .
it &apos;s like learning . .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experience and the idea of music to make it happen for another possibility , so an instrument , to make sound sound .
people who have never been re@@ he@@ ar@@ sed has never felt like they felt to form a sound , what it is to make
a phr@@ ase with his own breath . . .
the music stor@@ ing is the exten@@ sion of our body .
our vo@@ cal ch@@ or@@ ds to sing , our hands and feet to dance . . .
so the ham@@ mer heads in the piano the sequ@@ el of my fing@@ ers . .
the tun@@ e comes from the healthy and the rhyth@@ m of dance . . . .
the you continu@@ don ing &apos;t report need today to is make not music pro@@ even mot@@
when ing you . get bor@@ . ed . . . .
no longer necessary to whi@@ st@@ le or to whi@@ st@@ le .
every own music is being put up on plat@@ e-@@ front music , if you &apos;re s@@ laugh@@ ter@@ ing by the outside with
sure , there are some of you , you know , some of you who say yes , yes , but what do you do
the question i ask , can you sing , a because you believe they &apos;re not able to sing ? ,
or b because they didn &apos;t learn to sing ? ?
and it &apos;s not too late with them to start out if they can &apos;t , or learn how to put these little mus@@ cles that have the vo@@ cal ch@@ or@@ es , they use it right . . . . . .
you can train that . .
or c , because you &apos;ve made it den@@ sely you know that they &apos;re un@@
i wonder , how do i get a professional com@@ pe@@ sti@@ cian that diagno@@ se
do or you d have , a you two-@@ don - &apos;t or like third music , , how and to therefore tell
to you do that this day , ? and to ? do it that , way you ? know ,
but what i would do is , i would re@@ gre@@ t , because music is a nice , communication thing
but maybe you can agree . . .
well , you see , at all cases , nobody must be an ex@@ cep@@ tional can@@ di@@ date . .
but please don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t understand the classi@@ cal music . .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
and i say , but certainly you can say , you like it or not . . .
because i don &apos;t think he says i &apos;m wearing it , because i can &apos;t co@@ ok . , i can &apos;t co@@ ok .
so so , they you don don &apos;t &apos;t have get to to do eat the it classi@@ , cal just music because because
you they can don &apos;t &apos;t co@@ have ok an . instrument . . . . . .
listen whether consci@@ the ously music and is say pl@@ if enti@@ they ated taste to it
you or or not is . too c@@ . ute . . .
tell that what you feel .
over time , you get stimul@@ ies and you want to make a more em@@ it@@ t@@ ment , and you have a little bit more taste there and you
now , why do i solve my audience now that it &apos;s active ?
because the music is a language and a language is about communic@@ ating .
an art piece you can never look at , doesn &apos;t have any power to do . . .
the food that &apos;s coo@@ ked by a che@@ f or a che@@ f &apos;s char@@ ity must be e@@ aten , not only of vision or ex@@ clu@@ sion .
so please stop asking if there is a music
it &apos;s not just a nice so@@ und@@ she@@ g pe@@ te .
if you have an environment , when the adults are active with music , or at least active music , when they &apos;re going to be living in an environment , is it just easy for a music teacher , and they ask what color
can you play them in blue too ?
and the child is playing , after a thought , instead of a
and this sounds very different from before . than
that was the first start of a own musical expression . .
so the first step to a interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece now , the original one ago , a hundred or 100 years ago , was written in a hundred
mean@@ while , the instru@@ ments
there was no piano at the moment or an instrument still . . .
it wasn &apos;t invented . it was
i think the stream would have been fascin@@ ated if he had had the sound of modern fo@@ ods today . modern fo@@ ods . .
i can talk to the sound scen@@ es that the stream has taken on , on the modern wing , which can &apos;t make a b@@ aro@@ ck@@ ar c@@ em@@ bal@@ i .
and also from bee@@ tho@@ ven , he &apos;s heard more than he got a lot of time .
today , a modern orche@@ str@@ a is able to play everything that has been re@@ je@@ cted as a non-@@ play .
so the com@@ pos@@ ers are poin@@ ting to us that rein@@ v@@ ents the bits back . . .
and so you can hear that audi@@ tory , what you &apos;ve imag@@ ined in the mind .
and also what you would think about in the spirit . . .
or what i &apos;m seeing now , because what you might have
thank you .
you you know &apos;ve what ever is been ti@@
to d times ? ? . ?
and how did it feel ?
sh@@ it .
i have a friend who &apos;s driving a pas@@ ser@@ at@@ i .
when i come to my little v pi@@ es@@ el and i immediately come up with this feeling . . .
i sho@@ ot something through my head .
i &apos;m saying , do you need , what do you need to do , is
that &apos;s what &apos;s already going to get half his day .
and , at all , you &apos;re working much less than me .
why do i have to afford to buy a little car ?
and then i immediately think of that , that &apos;s un@@ fair . .
it &apos;s against justice .
and as i say the word justice , this un@@ pleas@@ ant feeling is
our organis@@ m has invented a great method to just get those un@@ comfortable feelings like just to get to disappe@@ ar . .
you can try it too , words like ra@@ tin or spr@@ ings or like the same . like that .
i want to talk to you about this mechan@@ ism now , or anything that &apos;s un@@ consci@@ ously familiar with you . as you &apos;re familiar with . . what you &apos;re un@@ aware
the mechan@@ ism comes from the lie .
but don &apos;t think of the lie as you might have heard about people , when people say nobody , nobody has the purpose of building
and then you throw down st@@ ones so that he sc@@ u@@ ps them . .
and you see , on a lie that &apos;s a lie that the li@@ ars believe not what he
it &apos;s slightly che@@ cking to be able to predict that it &apos;s very much in
it just dec@@ ei@@ ves you and not self-@@ . .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about has to do with being aware . . .
you need to have that lie to main@@ tain a li@@ ve@@ li@@ hood of a li@@ ft .
they can make them less easy , yes , or
you need time .
from that time , an an@@ ec@@ do@@ te that you might know .
span@@ and ish this pain@@ woman ter once p@@ com@@ ab@@ pla@@ l@@ ins o about pic@@ the as@@ portra@@ so it once
, did her a very woman didn portra@@ &apos;t yed see . it . . . . .
pic@@ as@@ so &apos;s waiting for you . . .
it &apos;ll be very similar to you . . .
at this point , if you &apos;re laugh@@ ing , you realize how important that lie is , and how much time you need to experience what artists can tell you very well . .
because artists have a dis@@ rup@@ tive relationship to the venti@@ lation .
the artist gives you something with you , and especially this lady , what she doesn &apos;t see when she &apos;s looking at the mirror
the artist will tell you in such a kind of portra@@ it something that you &apos;re going to be familiar with , if you look at this
and then this aw@@ k@@ ward feeling , it may not have to look like it , and it &apos;s always like a lot of it
here you have this mechan@@ ism where we can use the lie as a great invention for the kind of thing that we have to use .
and you not may only know in this art idea , of also the in d@@ the ame public that sc@@ looked ans up in every the morning my@@ and th@@ asked
ology him , who in is stories the , most they beautiful come all back over up the . country ? . , . in the . country
this spiegel , yes , is this mir@@ r@@ ors , yes , there &apos;s a spi@@
behind the seven of us and so forth .
and you also know how much ho@@ sti@@ li@@ ty of this real ex@@ tern@@ ality is , the mirror can &apos;t li@@ ft , from that real out@@ come . .
but we should just be tru@@ sting ourselves that one woman is not able to tell you that there &apos;s a more beautiful
so here &apos;s what we need to understand what we &apos;re understanding of poli@@ cing cor@@ rec@@ t@@
we we need have this not lie only to come susta@@ into in art the in illusion the that econom@@ susta@@ ist ins in us the ,
anthropo@@ without pe@@ even -@@ capable face of poetry even , going but to also live in . science like . this great . li@@
and there is this story from the bis@@ ho@@ o of wor@@ k@@ est . . .
and she heard about this book by charles darwin who &apos;s been de@@ forming of species and the stem of the human
that the mon@@ key was going to come from the mon@@ key , and yes , it would have to be at least a common ance@@ st@@ or between people and mon@@ keys .
and she ran off , she ran her man and said , that &apos;s , you know , he &apos;s not
the human one is supposed to be born or inv@@ o@@ ke common ance@@ st@@ or . .
no , no , no , it can &apos;t .
and if it &apos;s true , then we need to prevent that people will benefit knowledge
why do we have to stop people from getting knowledge from something , when it is
because without this kind of life we can &apos;t live .
because we have this self-@@ de@@ ception , this feeling , it &apos;s great , depen@@ ding on the highest creatures , not from an in@@ calcu@@ mer@@ ation of such a bl@@ ac@@ ding , of something like this , which is something that &apos;s in@@ her@@ ently ob@@ ta@@ ined about an organis@@ m that &apos;s still
so , we cannot do these things .
we need to prevent the people of knowledge of things , especially when they &apos;re true .
and so you can see how slowly this mechan@@ ism is going to un@@ ra@@ vel and how the tra@@ ces look , which leads to something else , than this great image of ourselves , i want to give you another story .
i think a particularly beautiful story , i think .
my wife told them . .
she came from school one day she &apos;s a teacher , and she was talking about a student . . a student . .
an au@@ ti@@ stic student . .
she li@@ kes to love it , because he &apos;s got a tenden@@ cy to pro@@ cla@@ im .
and she asked him , what are your ho@@ b@@ bi@@ es ? ?
and he says , you know , i &apos;m at the fire@@ man . .
and yeah because , i you &apos;m can in feel the it fire@@ when fire you , &apos;re i heal@@ &apos;m thi@@ interested er
in on py@@ this ro@@ spot mic . things there . &apos;s something . wrong . . . .
i told my wife always when a man in a moral fi@@ ction is using the word &quot; because it &apos;s what we should try and replace it through the liter@@
do you do that , and then you get the sentence . . . . . . . . . .
although i &apos;m at the fire@@ fire , i &apos;m interested in py@@ ro@@
you feel , this is the actual truth behind the a@@ ven@@ ue . . .
so , a little bu@@ b , though ,
the care is car@@ ing about the fire@@ place . care of the fire@@ place . care .
but there is no clu@@ e that we can look around , where you learn how to
there &apos;s only secon@@ d-@@ best , the fire@@
he &apos;s got on . . . . . . . . . . . . .
and that &apos;s not what he said to his teacher , but he &apos;s not saying to his teacher you &apos;d put down a br@@ us@@ hing and you &apos;re excited
no , it just looks much better if we
here you have this little mechan@@ ism . . . . . . . . . . .
these mis@@ sions that in the very light of the bu@@ mp , that in the very light of the bu@@ mp , he was actually in the middle of the bu@@ ck , but he can &apos;t say the sound . . . . . he can &apos;t
here you have this cha@@ ma@@ ma@@ cy between the un@@ conscious and the conscious , who immediately jum@@ ps , without any means can ,
and so you can just use these words that we
in fact , we know that something different is true . . . . . . . .
but we know that when we announ@@ ce
we can &apos;t just do that simple . . . . .
it &apos;s impossible to pres@@ ence those things that are supposed to work . .
i want to start to you what we found in my institute . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
what lo@@ gic does these del@@ u@@ sion , this self-@@ de@@ ception , the will@@ ing@@ ness
i want to give you two , maybe two examples . . . . . . . . .
the first one is that , as you know
i what mean &apos;s the the sou@@ sou@@ l l . ?
. ? . ? . ? .
the it sou@@ &apos;s l something is that something is that not is by a stop@@ kind e of t@@ con@@ all struc@@ , tive materi@@ , ality says nature about . lei@@ b@@ . ni@@ z . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
and when you have people who are the rich@@ ness of belief that they have a sou@@ l , or you can also say that they &apos;ve been brought from the sou@@ l to life , so they
and from that sou@@ l , you think , you know , that somehow , in this clou@@ d-@@ like nature , in this kind of fan@@ cy nature , anim@@ a is called it in
and when that trage@@ gue comes over the
and then he can walk on . . .
this is the idea of how the sou@@ l works
so it &apos;s going to come from outside to people . . . .
so we should be percei@@ ving them as something which is necessarily present for our lives . . . . . . . .
and if you have that pre@@ mis@@ e of the idea ,
because you now know you , can three apply of a you three-@@ remember sentence from appl@@
school et . . school . . . school . .
this is a three-@@ piece that descri@@ bes us a lo@@ gic . . .
this is the har@@ dest part in my talk . . . . .
here you have to have a lo@@ gic , but to lie . . . . . .
and that &apos;s how to lie that you can just use these
in this three-@@ piece , three sent@@ ences come in . in that three-@@ piece .
the first sentence is , well , you &apos;re cla@@ im@@ ing , there &apos;s no sou@@ l . . .
so the second sentence is , if you &apos;ve
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i &apos;ve particularly raised it up here . . . . . . . . . .
a third sentence that immediately shows up in people who have a very strong sense of a sou@@ l .
they say who &apos;s not a sou@@
and here you feel . . . . . .
here comes this lo@@ gic in this
you see it immediately . . . . .
the first two sent@@ ences , they
i can tell you all . . . .
the lo@@ gic does not make a stat@@ ement about reality . .
i can tell you the kan@@ n@@ ler is a man . . .
and if if i i don &apos;m &apos;t right have , a the right chan@@ , tr@@
the or can@@ is tr@@ a ine man is . not right . .
the lo@@ gic does not make a
i can argue anything . . . . . . .
but the key thing is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s
so if you say enough , there &apos;s no sou@@ l . . . a
second , if he &apos;s right , he has
these things are logi@@ cal cor@@ rect . . . . . .
and now our fa@@ ke consciousness is right , and it &apos;s now dete@@ cting our fa@@ ke consciousness . . . . . . . . . .
it &apos;s a third set that has nothing to do with the first two sent@@ ences
because , in fact , we had to prove it &apos;s the sou@@ l or not . . . . . . . . . . . . .
but with this lo@@ gic , which it just takes you , that two sent@@ ences
so , we pre@@ tend to be impossible without
and we &apos;re very happy about this . .
we can carry these things into different examples . . . . . . . . . .
in to the add present this , to we another have philosop@@ a hi@@ complete cal example issue of , one a of perman@@ the
ent things burning that , &apos;s a fil@@ perman@@ ling ent up , and as@@ again cent again . . present . .
so , that
there was a sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ry who was called a jo@@ han@@ nes bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ us , and after that , the bu@@
the bu@@ ri@@ an es@@ el is an es@@ p that &apos;s from p@@ ure nature .
it this didn is &apos;t a have natural that
thing sou@@ . l . .
and if you place the ex@@ act right between two uni@@ mag@@ in@@ cies , he sp@@ ill@@ ed . .
because he doesn &apos;t know what to do first of the pi@@ le of it .
so so he the &apos;s natural right things in are the
shown middle . . . in the .
equ@@ ally high forces with opposite pro@@ motion show . . . . .
there &apos;s nothing at all
and then , just when you bring another example , if you can get your other example , you &apos;ll need to get bigger , you don &apos;t need anything to do . . .
so auto@@ matically he &apos;s going to get the right thought
if you have this idea that you &apos;re in nature , you &apos;re actually driven by the larger por@@ tion of pi@@ le you &apos;re attra@@ cted to you , you &apos;re also going to feel that there &apos;s a thing as a free will .
and if we &apos;re in frank@@ ri@@ t , the main thing i remember is the ma@@ g@@ g@@ .@@ d.@@ -@@ institute of brain research . . .
there &apos;s a sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ry who is called &quot; wol@@ f sing@@ er , &quot; sometimes you say , &quot; wol@@ f , &quot; they &apos;re not going to be freedom .
now again , we can form the second sentence and say , if wol@@ f sing@@ er right , he doesn &apos;t have any freedom . .
these sent@@ ences are absolutely logi@@ cal and cor@@ rect . .
and now , every day , we can read that in the da@@ y@@ time , find in that third sentence . in
it &apos;s something like this , who &apos;s not going to have freedom of will@@ ance can &apos;t be pulled for his actions and comm@@ ands for responsibility , and therefore he &apos;s in@@
again , you have it again .
you know , you &apos;ve got to prove that there &apos;s such a thing as wel@@ bel@@ a &apos;s freedom .
but and the now lo@@ they gic can of just de@@ , ception if allows you us want to to do make this anything in , this if way you , want as to if make the anything first
you set want of , beginn@@ and ings all is of wrong the , particular than , the if first you set want of to pro@@ make pri@@ people et@@ happy ary , . that &apos;s . the
for example , if you &apos;re meeting a person that you can say , there are no predi@@
and you please don don &apos;t &apos;t have use to the call ger@@ that man , word this for is predi@@
a c@@ little ti@@ poli@@ ven@@ tically ess designed , thing which . is prop@@ . he@@ t .
you say , there are no predi@@ c@@ tives
you &apos;ll be on the immedi@@ ate , for example , that there &apos;s no such predi@@ c@@ table , you can &apos;t prove . , you can
and you have a problem . . .
because as you &apos;re bus@@ y , as you &apos;re bus@@ y , you &apos;re not able to prove that there &apos;s no predi@@ c@@ table , that &apos;s
he &apos;s happy about it , because he fa@@ ked them . .
because he &apos;s led them to a ri@@ dge that he doesn &apos;t stop
because this is actually a human being &apos;s difference . .
it &apos;s just that i &apos;m interested in having to be able to prove about themselves , that there &apos;s predi@@ c@@ table
so , in the sense of the re@@ creation of the sin@@ k , you have the mag@@ nifi@@ cent li@@ ft of the lie . .
and once again , if you have a chance to feel that three-@@ piece , that three-@@ ness , in some other people , they do it because they &apos;re not going to be able to remember them in that way . than they don
thank you for your attention .
yes , good after@@ noon .
i was allowed to ask li@@ l@@ ly if i could mention it . . . .
she &apos;s one of the major ent@@ ev@@ ators here , and asked me if i &apos;m going to give a lec@@ ture here and i
i have to say , you know , you &apos;ve got it , it &apos;s got me to start talking about my idea . .
and i might say maybe my in@@ fan@@ cy , i would like to imagine that i &apos;m trying to introduce
but of course , it &apos;s all the way , quite a lot of ideas
i &apos;m probably heard , these two ne@@ ap@@ -@@ girls are there , probably the generation that has gotten caught up for this bad au@@ ko image because i &apos;ve already started to study the nin@@ e-@@ 10 million se@@ a-@@ se@@ vent@@ -@@ 7@@ 0-@@ year categ@@ ory in kar@@ l@@ s@@ h , engineering college , which is now she calls , i think .
and it &apos;s got me wrong in the middle of the eastern 199@@ 0s , and it &apos;s going to be clear in the middle of the eastern 199@@ 0s , and that &apos;s not in kar@@ l@@
there was the nuclear research unit le@@ o@@ pol@@ ar . .
it was called the k@@ h@@ a , even the je@@ wish was called k@@ f@@ a . the je@@ wish . .
the wat@@ ers now project . . .
because good engineer is either built with a funny car or nuclear plants
but this is a little bit like , like , who@@ stupid , from which sort of a hundred wat@@ ts out of the square meter , it was a to@@ y .
and in ber@@ lin , there was a crazy engineering organization .
i &apos;m the pre@@ mi@@ um bi@@ as , man , that he &apos;s re@@ ac@@ ted the word again because after the crash , you didn &apos;t have to use the word , because it was all left . bad was bad . was bad .
but it was not that much in the a@@ ach@@ ine years .
it was like there was self-@@ admini@@ stra@@ tive operating operating , and one of them was actually sitting in cros@@ ch@@ y@@ bo@@ unds , where you think evil . .
and the place of terror@@ ism , but that was wus@@ sc@@ ared , and it was made wind and solar power , and i started in the middle of the eastern record . . in
and , yeah , a lot of what i &apos;m saying now are tou@@ ching me because many , many beautiful stat@@ ements were that i had lived through . .
i &apos;ve been working on colle@@ c@@ tively , this is bas@@ tical democra@@ tically . . .
we were 20 people . . . .
when a no@@ -@@ ever has said , the p@@ et@@ op@@ c@@ zi@@ p , which has a completely b@@ loo@@ d@@ shed , and i &apos;ve been very hard for 10 years to be able to really get my great engineering study , because all of my father &apos;s colleagues have told him , you &apos;ve got the money to go out of the window into your kid . .
it &apos;s with s@@ wee@@ g@@ dness . .
and it was really , very bit@@ ter and you can come in , &quot; oh , in this case , &quot; it &apos;s a picture that you could see , that was , you could see , that there was a picture of where i wonder@@ ed , for 10 years , a thousand , one in our colle@@ c@@ tivity , whether that should be really the great thing . , of course , it should
and i went to see it to si@@ x-@@ year-old , and then we got with friends with friends of sol@@ on , which then became one of the largest cell her@@ it@@ age workers in the world . one of the largest cell her@@ it@@ age workers in the world . . .
a huge story , of course , but we obviously have the problem of a growing company , and then we have two-@@ hour , a small group , decided that we can start again and go back and de@@ vote the next top@@ ic of the future , which means that , in my view , what &apos;s the qu@@ at@@ el that &apos;s going to do all of this , and that &apos;s what &apos;s happening again , again , that it &apos;s kind of nu@@ t again that people say , what is the qu@@ at@@ el
and i brought you a project that i want to consider you now .
and the theme of the talk was , as you get to a hundred percent rene@@ w@@ able . .
and we just started to ask from just a fairly simple kind of thing , where could you have a memory to be used today
on this island , this is the island of gra@@ ci@@ o@@ sa on the a@@ z@@ ors .
yes , these are the data .
there are four and a half thousand people living .
they have a rene@@ w@@ able energy rate today . . . . .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they ? ?
it &apos;s just not technologi@@ cally . .
if you &apos;re inter@@ acting more and more wind , it starts to fail . . .
i always tell you the politicians when they &apos;re in ber@@ lin@@ -@@ ad@@ ler sh@@ ard our plant . . .
they always say , why ? ?
we already have tw@@ ent@@ y of germany in germany
but can &apos;t be a problem .
but not , we have a number of percent in europe , and our network is physical , we &apos;ve seen the european . the european network .
if we were in europe 20 percent , we would have had the same problems that people have been on that island . .
the question was simple , calcu@@ lation was just a thousand years ago , the first pan@@ els began with the island , just by doing it . .
how big it would have to be , because actually , a battery is a battery so that you could get an island on 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , 50 , maybe se@@ vent@@ -@@ se@@ vent@@
and yeah , i go again a slide . .
the conven@@ tional system looks like this all over the world .
by the way , about a hundred gi@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts a year , they &apos;re going to build electric performance on the same level . on the
that &apos;s the power of a hundred nuclear power plants because it &apos;s going to travel fast . fast . .
the world &apos;s energy fam@@ ine , the world &apos;s going on , is being del@@ et@@ ed by this el , because you don &apos;t need any per@@ mission .
that &apos;s fast .
you can be a box . . .
and then it looks like this .
in the course of three , three of them are always wa@@ ited . . .
yes , this is a little bit of a load that is there . .
we have also got very pre@@ cise data .
and the wind force , or the solar system , or whatever it is , is typically a back@@ -up system , or whatever it is , is a system that can only be stor@@ ed in
our goal was to just say , okay . .
the el is going to be called so , and the wind , the sun , are the last to de@@ form the load , so that they can scale up
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent rene@@ w@@ ables , so energy per year , not the performance , then you have to turn off
that means that you have to make sure that the rene@@ w@@ ables are actually able to take the whole network . . .
and you can only , of course , just when you &apos;re going to be involved
this has nobody in the world . . .
this is about a small style , so you can also serve your rhe@@ tor@@ es in your car , you know , on a little bit
people are always asking me what did you do in ad@@ ler sh@@ ard ? ? in ad@@
that &apos;s what it &apos;s going
but if you want to ho@@ ok up multiple types of communication and build a net , it becomes extremely complicated . . . . .
and our goal was , we wanted to come to se@@ vent@@ -@@ 20 percent rene@@ w@@ ables , and then there &apos;s this rest , the last last , last decade , and it will be going to work , and that &apos;s not going to work , that you can do it from batter@@ ies . , very expensive , and that won &apos;t work , you can &apos;t do it from
it certainly becomes an energy assi@@ stance , which then , hydrogen , me@@ than@@ e , power to gas , you know or sound that will be . it will
you have to go beyond a seas@@ onal store and you have to do winter summer and not just ta@@ g night . . .
we just wanted to know what to do with normal , seem@@ ingly in@@ jun@@ si@@ ble electro@@ chemical battery . .
how far do you get there ? ?
and then we &apos;ve done a whole bunch of simulation . .
and have wind and sun , and the load is trans@@ mit@@ ted , and we came to the conclu@@ sion , a very exciting out@@ come that you need to get across the conven@@ tional system that takes a midd@@ le-@@ si@@ zed stra@@ in of about five cents a kil@@ o@@ wat@@ t-@@ hour , something like four cents a
these were the very first calcul@@ ies , six years ago
and then we said , okay .
yeah , we have a business model . model .
we are che@@ aper like the same system when the same price increase in the same five percent . . the same price
and then we started negoti@@ ating the insu@@ lin . .
what would be done ? .
have a commit@@ tee to inv@@ e@@ stors , i sel@@ ec@@ ted new entreprene@@ ners .
and we were at the time , at the time , to re@@ build the society . . .
and here , the repres@@ entation . .
the brown is kind of the conven@@ tional system , the green is our system . . .
that our system has also been an in@@ her@@ it@@ ance in our system , because we &apos;re still about 21 percent of these things , and we can &apos;t keep in the other things . . a price increase in
and the power@@ -@@ u@@ tili@@ ty that the power supply companies do on the island , they &apos;re quite a@@ wes@@ ome , we find
and we also want to support , but we don &apos;t believe that you can solve this problem . problem .
and so we decided to build a hal@@ f@@ way in ber@@ lin that we can actually re@@ p@@ ly the electrical conditions of the island at three very much pre@@ cis@@ ely . . . . .
that is , we first read that the world &apos;s largest battery on the
here it is .
it &apos;s natural from asia , where you &apos;re in from japan .
and funny enough , it &apos;s in the se@@ vent@@ h book at b@@ b@@ c man@@ h@@ heim , and today , it was developed and it was licen@@ sed to the japanese . a japanese
you can see it &apos;s a very , very large battery . . .
it has a me@@ ga@@ watt power , and can bring six hours to do this , and that &apos;s the battery that we got sort of out of the process of simul@@ ating
and then have that place .
we also have one of those same ag@@ gre@@ gate gate in the same size as it is there , it would actually take the full dynamic behavior from this web , so that in the hall it looks like this , it &apos;s just like this el , here &apos;s the big battery that &apos;s going on , and here &apos;s the whole thing , that we simul@@ tane@@ ously simul@@ tane@@ ously simul@@
over here , we simul@@ ating the whole trans@@ mission system , which is the kilometers of 100 kilometers of c@@ able to actually map the vi@@ bra@@ tion behavior on the network . . .
and here you can see the whole thing . .
we can also turn two kil@@ o@@ wat@@ ts to the web . . . . . .
here we see again again , again , again , the whole single ag@@ gre@@ gate . , again , the whole single ag@@
and what we did , since two , a thousand , was that it was all done , until today , two centi@@ -@@ six , just had to do anything in between the single system of electr@@ on@@ ics , to create software , we did . .
so we &apos;re not a battery manufac@@ tur@@ er , but we define ourselves as a fir@@ m that is only between the subject of battery and the issue of the problem and everything in between . .
you have to communicate , of course , to communicate in the grid , you can communicate in the grid , and that &apos;s very complicated
the beauty is that you have basically to take this out of this island , and it &apos;s basically all the advan@@ tages that we &apos;re going to get when we &apos;re going to increase our share of rene@@ w@@ ables
so this whole discussion , what &apos;s going on right now and forth , and moving , as we should go on the island , for example , we have a five-@@ year ex@@ cess ex@@ ex@@ c@@ ant , so we have to have the win@@ ds , and the sun .
natural light then puts smart mat@@ ches . . .
so , smart br@@ us@@ hes , a big top@@ ic . .
we can start to inte@@ gra@@ te the island of electro@@ mo@@ bility , asking ourselves , you can &apos;t help because the bur@@ den of
that means , if you &apos;re in se@@ vent@@ 25 percent rene@@ w@@ able , you won &apos;t be able to make that without the white . . . .
you can &apos;t take through n bra@@ king ta@@ pe , you can pan@@ p through the nets , yeah , you should be doing it , the percentage , but you will never be able to completely completely lose the amount , but
and so it &apos;s a message that is the
so many people get and look at this , because you can see what the problems are . one can see
if we turn down the el , you don &apos;t have any more of these ro@@ tat@@ ing mass that causes a certain kind of in@@ er@@ ti@@ a on the grid . .
and our european al@@ lies basically have just a l@@ ord ro@@ tat@@ ing mass of big power plants where the wave all around europe is moving around across europe . .
we look into this web , see the 50 her@@ tz , and if it &apos;s nine in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ory nine her@@ t , we &apos;re beginning to make some val@@ ves , then again , a little bit of a sc@@ ame ste@@ am in , then we &apos;ll come back
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , it &apos;s incredibly high .
if you s@@ mil@@ l it , it &apos;s going to take a
the sp@@ ell reser@@ ves have at least 10 seconds to keep the web stable .
and in the time you can re@@ act again .
if you don &apos;t have that , these ro@@ tat@@ ing mass , you have to replace it with a force tra@@ de-@@ bon@@ on@@ ics and electro@@ chemistry
and we can actually turn two milli@@ seconds out of that , two milli@@ seconds . .
and then you see the enormous speed of speed there . .
and the message now is , we need to put down this ro@@ tat@@ ing force if we can , sort of , ad@@ v@@ ance our goals , 20 , 20 percent , 20 percent , 20 percent , and so on , if we want to get access to everyone . .
then we have to down@@ load our mu@@ tive do@@ ta@@ il@@ ies on the net . .
mu@@ st-@@ run is simply , the power plant goes with it , to keep the current .
yes , that &apos;s a huge debate right now , building the coal fi@@ ber , because otherwise we don &apos;t have ga@@ ins , because it &apos;s not . ga@@ ins . . . .
and we &apos;re just trying to make clear that you can break the capacity , the mu@@ st-@@ run , to de@@ grade the electro@@ chemical circu@@ it , by bringing electro@@ chemical memory to the grid . .
now , fortunately , there &apos;s a whole lot of studies now . .
and that &apos;s what people get , and then they look at our experiment@@ al team , and we just look at our in@@ fan@@ test
and yes , the discussion goes around the question of how far can you take a piece of future . future
and many discus@@ sions that i &apos;ve been in for the last six years have been similar to the discussion i &apos;ve had in the last 30 years about photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics
no matter is a very strong , child &apos;s game , we just mis@@ sed everything that we just do . . . . .
we have three gi@@ ga@@ watt gi@@ ga@@ watt in germany today . . .
this is the model . .
and i just think that we will have the same capacity in the next 30 years of the same capacity on the world . in the next 30 years
it &apos;s just that it &apos;s going to come .
there &apos;s going to be a whole lot of conditions and argu@@ ing .
and the beauty is that i &apos;ve been seeing right now in the last two years , that scientists are asking me on my
we &apos;ve got over 10 million pro@@ cations , too , like , &quot; ne 10 me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t-@@ battery battery now to sti@@ ff the ger@@ man
this is going on next to ap@@ ri@@ l .
so you know , you know , there &apos;s a change there and there &apos;s only that de@@ di@@ cation to you , to the idea that a hundred percent rene@@ w@@ able is true .
and if you have a hundred percent rene@@ w@@ ables , it &apos;s like an au@@ v@@ ant system . . .
so far , in discussion , it &apos;s all been trying to do this insu@@ lin , that &apos;s making self-@@ repli@@ cam@@ es , they have a own little web , which has to do with our al@@ lies with our al@@ lies
the question is that simple , if you can completely make any of the fossil or any of the other things that are out@@ -@@ of-@@ the-@@ world ex@@ ecu@@ tives , or be brought in anywhere around the world and
then they only use what &apos;s there on the sun and the wind , where they live . .
and that &apos;s kind of a little bit of our vision of a pre@@ cious energy supply , and i &apos;m a cra@@ d@@ le to cra@@ d@@ le that they said using solar power .
and that &apos;s what we do , and it &apos;s what we do , and it &apos;s where the talk comes from pre@@ mi@@ um colum@@ ns , that you can be a colle@@ c@@ tively and use sun@@ energy here , and here &apos;s a little
and yeah , i just want to encourage you to just be a bit of crazy , in the sense that you may be quie@@ t and you can have a vision
and you really have to stay pretty clo@@ sely with it , but i think it &apos;s going to happen . .
thank you .
when steve lo@@ pe@@ z , col@@ um@@ bia , the los angeles times , went to the center of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an afri@@ can@@ -@@ american , sym@@ pa@@ thetic , ra@@ y , hom@@ eless , who played on a vio@@ lin only two se@@ ed . .
many of you will know the story , because of ste@@ p-@@ artic@@ an , later , it was a book that was fil@@ med again , with robert dow@@ ney j@@ uni@@ or as steve lo@@ pe@@ z and jam@@ ie fo@@ x@@ x as a na@@ than@@ iel anth@@ ony , who ended up in the con@@ tr@@ ist of ju@@ il@@ li@@ ar@@ ic conser@@ v@@ atory and the promis@@ ing of the day of a jo@@ int career of a day of early , over@@ lying his par@@ an@@ o@@
na@@ than@@ iel left ju@@ il@@ li@@ ard , and suff@@ ered a break@@ down and he lived for 30 years later as hom@@ eless people on the streets of sk@@ id row , in the center of los angeles . in
i re@@ com@@ mend all of you , i re@@ com@@ mend reading a book or look at the film so that you don &apos;t just understand the wonderful connection that happened between these two men , but also how the music was helping that connection and how it was , as it was , that the music is allowed to help you get this
i met m@@ r a@@ yers in 2008 , two years ago , in the wal@@ t dis@@ ney mar@@ ked in
he had just heard a little bit of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s first and fourth sin@@ ph@@ ony , and came back the stage to imagine me .
he was talking in a very hot and heal@@ ing note about yo@@ -@@ yo ma and h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton and how the do@@ d@@ gers never would create into the base@@ ball world record , and all of that because of the con@@ sen@@ su@@ al pas@@ sage of be@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s fourth , the last re@@ fra@@ ming of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s fourth sin@@
we got to the issue of music , and a few days later , i got an email that said that na@@ than@@ iel was interested in me for self-@@ assem@@ bly .
i still have to mention that na@@ than@@ iel had had a medical treatment , because he had already been treated with electro@@ sho@@ cks and tra@@ ins , a trau@@ ma that has been pur@@ su@@ ing his entire life . . . . his
now , as a result , he &apos;s particularly vulnerable to these schizophren@@ ic ph@@ ases , sometimes it &apos;s as bad as it goes , and he went away in the streets of the sk@@ id row , and then he &apos;s got this hor@@ ror and the following of his own spirit . a hor@@ ror , and he expres@@ sed his own spirit
and in the same way , that &apos;s a concent@@ ration of na@@ than@@ iel , when we first did the lesson in the wal@@ t dis@@ ney , started to see in the wal@@ t dis@@ ney , and he had completely lost this ir@@
he talked about invisible mur@@ ders and smo@@ ke and how he wanted somebody to di@@ ve in the sleep . . .
i was afraid not to do it , but i was sc@@ ared of being able to lose him , that he could lose him in his circum@@ stances , and that i could destro@@ y his relationship with the vio@@ lin , if i started talking about ca@@ king and ca@@ pe@@ g@@ gi@@ os and other exciting forms of di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic . . . . &amp; gt ;
so i just started playing . .
i was playing the first sentence of bee@@ tho@@ ven vio@@ lin conc@@ eit . .
and as i was playing , i realized that in na@@ th@@ iel &apos;s eyes was a complete change . . .
it was like having the influence of an un@@ seen drug , a chemical reaction , which was cat@@ aly@@ st my play . . . . . .
na@@ than@@ iel &apos;s man@@ ic z@@ or@@ n was turning into understanding , in quie@@ t curi@@ osity and gra@@ ce . .
and as you take a mira@@ cle by his mira@@ cle , he started playing his g@@ aller@@ y , and then he asked me to finish , and then i would say she would play -- docum@@ ented s@@ kins , t@@ she@@ i@@ ko@@ v@@ i , si@@ ber@@ li@@ us . . . .
we started talking about music , from b@@ ach over to bee@@ tho@@ ven , bra@@ h@@ ms , pi@@ ck@@ ers , all the other bs , bar@@ to@@ k , all the other bs , from bar@@ to@@ k to es@@ a pe@@ k@@ ka .
and i realized that he had not only had an en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pe@@ di@@ an knowledge of music , but it was also a close personal relationship . .
he talked about her with a passion and understanding that i only know what i was doing in my colleagues in phil@@ harmon@@ y of los
by playing music and talking about music , this par@@ an@@ o@@ id , conf@@ used , man , just tra@@ ced the streets of los angeles , a lo@@ or@@ -@@ com@@ powered , educ@@ ated , pain@@ ted , pain@@ ted , ju@@ il@@ li@@ ard . a musi@@ cian . sophisticated musi@@ cians .
music is medicine . music changes us .
na@@ than@@ iel means music sou@@ li@@ an health . .
because the music allows it to re@@ form his thoughts and del@@ u@@ sions with his imagination and his creativity into something real . .
and so he &apos;s going to be so ki@@ dna@@ pping his el@@
i understood that this is the nature of art . . .
that &apos;s why we do the reason why we make music , so that we can put something in deep inside of our arti@@ stic l@@ ens , through our creativity , to the reality that we can bring . in our arti@@ stic l@@ ens , through our creativity ,
and the reality of this expression comes all over us , and moves , inspired us and f@@ ed us . .
what na@@ than@@ iel ran him , he brought music back to a community of friends .
the power of music has taken him back into a family of musi@@ cians who understood him , recogni@@ zed his talent and te@@ sted him . . . .
and i will always do with na@@ than@@ iel &apos;s resources , whether it &apos;s in the wal@@ t dis@@ ney ju@@ te , or in a wal@@ t , because he re@@ minds me why i became musi@@ cians .
thank you .
br@@ un@@ o gi@@ u@@ tly : thank you . thank you .
robert gu@@ p@@ ta .
robert gu@@ p@@ ta : i want to play something that i have to make sure that i have to get to the most c@@ elli@@
i hope you &apos;ll for@@ give me .
so i &apos;ve been ch@@ opp@@ ing many fish in my life .
i only loved two . .
this first one , this was more like a passionate mon@@ key .
it was a lo@@ vely fish , deli@@ cious , good consi@@ stent , including a best , a s@@ eller . . .
what a fish .
even better yet , he was raised in a@@ qu@@ ak@@ ul@@ ture after the biggest standards of
so you could feel to sell it . .
i had a relationship with this beauty over several months . .
one day , the leader &apos;s head was asked , if i could do a s@@ ession on the sustain@@ ability of the farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
here was a company trying to solve what &apos;s become this uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able problem for our che@@ fs , how do we keep our fish on our bo@@ xes ?
in the last 50 years we have fis@@ her@@ ed the ocean as we &apos;ve be@@ gun fore@@ sts . .
it &apos;s hard to over@@ come the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tun@@ a , the cure , the sal@@ t@@ ga@@ ge , the squ@@ ar@@ es , heavy fish , they broke together . . .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , maybe the mis@@ si@@ le of a@@ qu@@ ak@@ ul@@ ture , they may be a part of our future . . . .
many argu@@ ments against it : fis@@ her@@ y fis@@ her@@ ies pollu@@ te , the environment most of them , and they &apos;re in@@ efficient , we take tun@@ a . a huge dec@@ line .
he &apos;s got a 15@@ -@@ to-@@ one record . . . .
that is , 15 pounds of wild fish need to get a po@@ und to give a po@@ und to do .
not very sustainable .
nei@@ ta@@ s don &apos;t taste very well .
so , finally , there was a company trying to do it right .
i wanted to support them .
the day before the event , i called the ce@@ on of public public work for the company .
let &apos;s call him . .
&quot; don &apos;t , &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts to get right , you &apos;re famous for building that way far out in the ocean that you &apos;re not pollu@@ ted .
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . we are so far out that the waste from our fish is being raised , not concent@@ rate . &quot; . &quot;
and then he ad@@ ded , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world . . .
and the ex@@ act of 2.@@ 5 to one , &quot; he said . . .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
2.@@ 5 to one , great .
&quot; 2,@@ five to one ? what is your feed ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . i did . .
and that night , i was in bed and thinking , what the hell is a sustainable protein ? ? ?
so the next day , just before the event , i just started to speak
i said , &quot; don &apos;t , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot; ?
he said he didn &apos;t know that . he &apos;ll ask .
now , i got an appli@@ mented with a couple of people in the company . nobody could give me a pro@@ per answer , until finally , to the ex@@ act bi@@ ologists . .
we also don &apos;t call him .
&quot; don &apos;t , &quot; i said , &quot; what are sustainable proteins ? &quot; ?
now , he mentioned some al@@ ga@@ e and some fish me@@ als , and then he said , chicken pel@@ lets .
i said , &quot; chicken . pel@@ g@@ a pel@@
he said , &quot; yes , fe@@ a@@ thers , skin , bone fl@@ our , re@@ main ge@@ es@@ ky , ge@@ hr@@ u@@ ed and process@@ ed .
i said , &quot; how much of your money do you have chicken ?
probably two percent in the pres@@ um@@ ption .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t you know what to do in a gro@@ cer@@ y store of
there was a long pause in the track , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken on the world . &quot;
i was thri@@ ll@@ ed about this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a self-@@ ser@@ gh@@ te@@ er and a gu@@ inn@@ ar . . .
i &apos;m actually in this
no , i actually loved it from this fish because i &apos;m swe@@ ying in god , because i swe@@ ar to god who &apos;s been ch@@ as@@ ing a fish
that second fish , this is another type of love history . .
it &apos;s the roman@@ tic way of learning the way you learn your fish , you love the fish more . stuff .
i first e@@ aten him in a restaurant in southern spa@@ in .
a friend of mine was talking about this fish for a long time .
it &apos;s kind of la@@ id us up
he came up with a bright , almost glo@@ vering white color . . .
che@@ f had coo@@ ked it . .
hold twice . .
he was still more che@@ at@@ ly . .
who can make a fish so well after he was de@@ co@@ ded ? ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can do it
let &apos;s call it mi@@ gu@@ el , in fact , called mi@@ gu@@ el .
and no , he didn &apos;t co@@ ok the fish , and he &apos;s not a che@@ f , and at least in the way that you understand and i understand .
he &apos;s a biolog@@ ist at v@@ et@@ a la pal@@ m .
this is a fis@@ her@@ -up fish up in the sou@@ th@@ west corner .
it &apos;s near the co@@ ding of the river of the river . . .
up to the 198@@ 0s , the farm was in the hands of ar@@ gent@@ ina . .
they raised meat c@@ attle on what was essentially we@@ t@@ ling . .
they did that by de@@ di@@ cated to the land
they built this complicated sequence of chan@@ n@@ els , and they ur@@ ge water from land out of the country and out into the
now , they couldn &apos;t succe@@ ed that the val@@ ve wasn &apos;t being
and e@@ col@@ o@@ gic , it was a cat@@ astrop@@ he .
it and took so about in 90 198@@ percent 2 of , the a birds span@@ , ish which company are has
a bought lot the of land birds . . . a lot . of birds . .
what do they do ?
they have rever@@ se the flow of water .
they literally put the le@@ ver .
instead of pus@@ hing the water out , they would use the chan@@ n@@ els to re@@ move the water
they f@@ ought the can@@ als . .
they created a 1@@ 1,000 ac@@ re fishing fish -- bar@@ k , sea , gar@@ ri@@ mp , a@@ al -- and the mi@@ gu@@ el de@@ di@@ cated to mi@@ gu@@ el and his company , the e@@ col@@ o@@ gical destruction of completely rever@@ se
the farm is incredible .
i mean , they &apos;ve never seen this before . .
they star@@ ve at the hori@@ zon , a million miles away is a million miles away , and all you see are flo@@ f@@ ted can@@ als and those den@@ sity , l@@ eng@@ th of
i was not there at the time in mi@@ cr@@ el .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin and some part , a cro@@ co@@ di@@ le to the k@@
okay ? there we were , fighting by the we@@ t@@ lands , and i swe@@ at , and i swe@@ at , i got ti@@ d@@ ch to my k@@ ne@@ es , and mi@@ p@@ el kee@@ ps a biology lec@@ ture . . .
here now he , is he pi@@ said cking the up miner@@ a al rare needs net of .
phy@@ top@@ . lan@@ k@@ . ton . . . . .
and it here turns , out here that , mi@@ here p@@ &apos;s el a is pattern the of most b@@ part und@@ of les his
that career remember in it mi@@ at k@@ the um@@ tanz@@ i ani@@ national an park gi@@ in ra@@ africa ffe . . .
i asked him , how was it becoming a fish that was like this
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish . .
i &apos;m an exper@@ t on relationships . &quot;
and then he goes and s@@ we@@ ak into more pre@@ cise flo@@ ws and al@@ ga@@ e and wei@@ gh@@ ty water plants .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , bio@@ tic community , like this . . . .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head was we@@ ak about this de@@ co@@ cted piece of peace fish that i had at the fore@@ front .
so i went down . i said , &quot; mi@@ h , how come your fish &apos;s going to taste so well ? &quot;
he poin@@ ted out the al@@ ga@@ e .
&quot; i know , boy , the al@@ ga@@ e , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible . .
but what do you eat when you fish
how is the food process@@ ing ? &quot; process@@ ing ?
now he &apos;s driving to me telling me that it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish are eating what they would eat in the wild .
the plan@@ n@@ able bio@@ mass , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , the zo@@ op@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , that &apos;s what the fish feed .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally self-@@ suff@@ i@@ ci@@ ently
there &apos;s no food .
anyone on a farm who doesn &apos;t feed their animals ? ?
later on , on this site , i went around with mi@@ go , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems so natural , &quot; unlike any farm i &apos;ve ever been , &quot; how do you measure success ? &quot; farm
at the moment , a film director would have dem@@ and@@ ed a play@@ w@@ ball change .
and we bo@@ w around the corner , and we gave the most incredible look , thousands and thousands of roll@@ ers of fl@@ amin@@ gos , a literally tri@@ cky ch@@ at@@ ter , a little bit like
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your b@@ ars , p@@ ink .
they &apos;re mal@@ m . &quot; .
bad ? i was completely conf@@ used . conf@@ used
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , don &apos;t you get your fish ? &quot; , do you
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent from our fish and fish eg@@ gs to birds .
well , last year , in this site , 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 birds were in this site , more than 250 different
it &apos;s the biggest and one of the most important private reser@@ ves of europe today . . . . . .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , is a well-@@ e@@ er@@ a@@ ging a@@ vi@@ an a@@ vi@@ an a@@ vi@@ an a@@ vi@@ ation ,
he sha@@ ke his head , no .
he said , &quot; we build more sophisticated , not inten@@ sive . .
this is an e@@ col@@ o@@ gical network .
the fl@@ amin@@ gos eat the sh@@ ri@@ mp .
the so sh@@ the ri@@ pin@@ mp der hat@@ is es the the better phy@@
the top@@ system lan@@ . k@@ &quot; ton . the system . .
okay , so let &apos;s think . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals and make a farm that meas@@ ures its success in the health of her predat@@ or &apos;s health .
a fis@@ her@@ -up fish , but also a bird reser@@ ve .
oh , and by the way , these fl@@ amin@@ gos should not even exist there . from 196@@ 1 . in
they bre@@ ed in a city of 2@@ 40 kilometers where the ground com@@ po@@ unding is better for the nest building
every and morning every , night they , fly they 2@@ &apos;re
40 going miles 2@@ to 40 the miles farm back . .
they do it because they can follow the red white line of san 9@@ 2 . a land@@ line .
seriously . .
i was imag@@ ining myself a kind of journey of pengu@@ ins , so i looked at mi@@ gu@@ el . .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , are you flying 2@@ 40 miles on the farm and then you &apos;re going to finish it 2@@ 40 miles back
do they do that ? &quot; that &apos;s for
he looked at me as if i had just quot@@ ed a song by the whit@@ ney hou@@
he said , &quot; no . you do it because food is better . &quot; .
i don &apos;t mention the skin of my belo@@ ved fish , the che@@ fs being , and i don &apos;t like a fish of fish . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it . her .
it &apos;s that per@@ forming , low-@@ cost taste . .
i almost never did it . .
and yet , when i tried it in the restaurant in southern spa@@ in , she didn &apos;t s@@ hr@@ ink her fish . .
she was typ@@ ing swe@@ et and bu@@ ried in as if you &apos;d take a bi@@ te off the
i he mentioned said this , to &quot; mi@@ the gu@@ skin el works ,
like and a he spon@@ was ge not . ki@@ cked . .
she &apos;s the last shor@@ ter before something gets into the body .
it &apos;s evolved throughout evolution to look at un@@ cont@@ ents . &quot;
and then he ad@@ ded up , &quot; but our water doesn &apos;t have any cont@@ amin@@ ants .
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your fish -- a farm that measure its success in their her@@ bi@@ ties . . .
and then i realized when he says a farm that doesn &apos;t have cont@@ amin@@ ants , he does have tremendous because the water that flo@@ ws through this farm comes from the river gu@@ ad@@ ag@@ pe@@ vi@@ r . . a her@@ it@@ age water coming
it &apos;s a river that leads to all the things that are now testing , to lead to chemical pollu@@ tan@@ ts , waste of pe@@ sts . from pe@@ p@@ pe@@
and when it ra@@ mm@@ ed through the system and it left this notion of water , it &apos;s clean , as it came
the system is so healthy ; it cle@@ ans water . . .
so not only a farm that fe@@ e@@ ds its animals , not just a farm that &apos;s meas@@ uring their success in the health of their predat@@ or , but a farm that &apos;s literally a water supply plant , and not just for those fish , but for y@@ ourselves and me . . .
because when the water flo@@ ws out , it lo@@ ses into the atlan@@ tic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i take it , and this is what you should do , because these love of love , as roman@@ tic is , is also an
you might say that you might be a reci@@ pe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about bar@@ t or meat or meat .
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one where food really ta@@ ils good . . .
but for a lot of people , this is a little bit radical .
we &apos;re not reali@@ stic . we &apos;re enjo@@ y@@ able . we &apos;re lo@@ vers .
we love markets markets . we love small family leaders , we talk about land food . we &apos;re talking about the vi@@ ral
and if they cla@@ im that this is the things that the future of good food is going on anywhere somewhere in it and says , &quot; hey people , i love p@@ ink fl@@ amin@@ gos , but how are they going to feed the world ? a
how are they going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
no , not because we produce enough cal@@ ories to feed the world more than just fe@@ eding
one billion people will be hun@@ gry today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- due to cr@@ ash@@ ing dis@@ par@@ ate levels , not the total production .
well , i don &apos;t like this question because they &apos;ve been func@@ tion@@ ing the lo@@ gic of our food system over the last 50 years
pa@@ -@@ fe@@ ti@@ l@@ ating cor@@ r@@ in of plants , bo@@ s@@ l@@ fire com@@ po@@ und , chemicals to the earth , chicken to fish , and all the time has the agri@@ cultural industry just , &quot; if we feed more people how bad can that be ? &quot; that &apos;s
that was the easier part . it was the service plan ; it was the business plan of american agriculture . the business
we should call them what it is that it is , a pra@@ yer in a par@@ alle@@ l , a pra@@ yer that is fast to e@@ col@@ o@@ gical capital that is actually
this is not a craft , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our cor@@ n cham@@ ber today is under threat , not because of ab@@ pi@@ pi@@ ating , but because of the ex@@ pi@@ p@@ ation of resources .
not through the ne@@ west hun@@ ting and tra@@ w@@ ot@@ -@@ scan@@ ning innovation , but by fru@@ it land , not through pump@@ s , but by the shor@@ e-@@ si@@ zed land , not through pump@@ s , but by the forest , not through the cy@@ cl@@ ens and the nets , but
they want to feed the world ?
so let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves
or to better do , that how , can don we &apos;t create look conditions at that the
produce agri@@ every cultural community model to for feed the themselves future ? . ? .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done . .
capital , chemistry and machines are at this level , and it &apos;s never really produ@@ c@@ tively produ@@ c@@ tively produ@@
let &apos;s take a look at e@@ col@@ o@@ gical model . .
this is the one that car@@ es back to two billion years of labor . .
look at mi@@ gu@@ el , farmers like mi@@ gu@@ el .
that is , not the world for itself , operating , re@@ produce , rather than just en@@ ligh@@ ter , but not only inten@@ sive , but not only inten@@ sive , but experts for relationships . not only , but experts for relationships . .
because they are the ones who are experts who are too experts . .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re better than i &apos;m ever going to be . than i &apos;m ever
you know , i &apos;m right , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it will be deli@@ cious . . is it
thank you .
if i want to teach you a subject today , it is that the whole thing that we consu@@ me is that the whole thing that we consu@@ me is the sum of the data that we consu@@ me , and instead of thinking about information over@@ load , i want you to think about how we can use information to be able to take , and we realize so that it
so what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical star record to be applied to age . .
the program that i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called pi@@ vo@@ t and what i can do with pi@@ vo@@ t is , after a certain death cause , i can filter out acci@@ dents . cr@@ ash@@ es .
and immediately i see another pattern that &apos;s coming up . . . .
and that is , because in the middle area here , people are most active and they &apos;re most likely to be in the most ab@@ und@@ ant .
we can go further and go and see the data and see that the data that &apos;s the standard sus@@ pe@@ cts , but not for everyone . disease . . for everyone . .
now , if we go forward , we &apos;re going to see it for age 40 or more , we &apos;re going to see that acci@@ dents should even be the leading cause of people
and who &apos;s going to see research on research , that &apos;s especially true to men .
so you can see that this is a lot of information and data in that way very much remin@@ is@@ cent of the amount of time in a living ima@@ ging system .
and if we can do this for ra@@ w data , why can &apos;t be the case for content itself ?
now what we have here is the cover of each individual &apos;s spor@@ ts illu@@ sions , which has ever
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online . .
you like to test it for my talk in your rooms . .
they can come into a decade . , they can come into a
you you can can go jump into directly a to
single a year particular . ti@@ p . .
now , if i look here , i see the ath@@ le@@ tes coming out of that pres@@ ent@@ ations and the spor@@ ts events .
i &apos;m a lan@@ ce arm@@ strong fan , so i click here by doing all of these pa@@ pers in the lan@@ ce arm@@ strong . . . . . . . .
now , if i want to get one bigger over@@ look , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at everything with bi@@ cycle cy@@ cles ? &quot; ? &quot; ?
so i go back and further further and further further . .
now i see gre@@ g le@@ mond . .
and so you get an idea that if you can go through this kind of information , you know , you &apos;re going to zo@@ om , you know , wi@@ der , you &apos;re going to zo@@ om out , you don &apos;t find it out
you make something that &apos;s actually a slightly different way . .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s in between and we think it &apos;s changing the way that information can
now i want to do this idea a little bit more with something that is kind of crazy . .
what we did here is we took every single wiki@@ pe@@ di@@ as@@ ic ye@@ te , re@@ duced them to a small p@@ ace .
the sum@@ mary con@@ tains a short over@@ view and a symbol of the space that it comes from . a symbol of it . a symbol of it
i &apos;ll just show the top 500 of the world &apos;s most popular wiki@@ pe@@
but even in that in@@ conven@@ i@@ ent view we can do a lot of things
immediately , we get a sense of the top@@ ics that are popular on wikipedia . . . . .
i &apos;m going to vote about government government . .
now , after i &apos;ve cho@@ sen the government , i realize that the wikipedia ag@@ ents that cover the most of the time &apos;s magazine are &quot; people of the year . &quot;
this is really important because this is an insi@@ ght that is not in a single industri@@ es . . .
that &apos;s just when you step back and look at it . . . . .
and looking at one of these sum@@ mar@@ ies , i can then go into the theme of time maga@@ zin@@ es &quot; people of the year , see all of them .
now , when i look at all these people , i realize that the majority of this is govern@@ ance of govern@@ ance , some come from science -- some of them even less , come from the economy . here &apos;s my bo@@ ss , and one
and interest@@ ingly , bon@@ o is a ted prize prize . . .
so we can jump and take a look at every ted prize . . . . .
you can see , we &apos;re sur@@ fing the first time that it really is a network , not just from page to page , but much more abstra@@ ct . . . . .
and so i want to show you what a little surprise might be . . . .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times site .
pi@@ vo@@ t , this appli@@ cation -- i don &apos;t want to call a brow@@ ser ; it &apos;s really not a brow@@ ser , but you can look at web@@ sites -- and we &apos;re taking this zo@@ om technology to every single website like this . one of these .
so i can take a step back , and i jump right to a specific
so this is important because you only look at the web site in this way , you can look at the whole way across the internet . the same way across the internet . the same way .
so here and i &apos;s i can the can zo@@ state just om of take in the anything into
entire i a demon@@ &apos;ve zo@@ stration seen om i now in &apos;ve , a been back particular keeping
in line up this . to room this . . . . . .
and , again , if i just step out and look at everything , i can go back to see what i mean , maybe , to my search past , and here i &apos;m looking for the ne@@ po@@ ti@@ stic news , here &apos;s after bing , or here &apos;s going to be live lab@@ s
and from here , i can go back to the side and re@@ store them again . .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s being used over and over again , and every time it does it , it does the big picture that the amount of data
right now , in this world , we think that data is a s@@ ale . .
we &apos;re talking about the s@@ hal@@ ing of information over@@ all
we &apos;re talking about the dro@@ w@@ ning in information
what if we could turn that situation around , and turn the internet on its head so that instead of going to the other , we can go from a lot of things to a lot of things , and by doing some patterns that were left to the hidden ones ? the pattern of things that were left to be hidden ?
if we can do that , these are the data sets , maybe a new source of information . a new source
and , instead of just moving into information , we can get out of that .
and if we know knowledge then we can even draw equ@@ als from that . .
and that &apos;s when i stop , thank you
i grew up with a nar@@ row por@@ tion of science fi@@ ction .
i was driving on the bus , every day , an hour every day . a day
and my nose always kept in a book , a sci@@ en@@ ce-@@ fi@@ ction book that was my mind in different worl@@ ds and walking on my deeply immer@@ sive to me , un@@ wa@@ sted curi@@ osity . satis@@ fying . satis@@ fying .
these curi@@ osity also showed up that when i was not in school , i was going through the fore@@ sts , and i walked , &quot; sam@@ ples &quot; and i &apos;d run fro@@ gs and sna@@ kes and bu@@ f@@ les , all of them , and they &apos;d watched them go home under the microscop@@ e . . . .
i was totally a science , you know . .
it was all about trying to understand the world and to try to solve the limit@@ s of the
and jac@@ my ques love cou@@ to ste@@ science au fi@@ came ction in would into appe@@ our al living in room my with environment his , amazing because shows back that in animals the and late places &apos; and 6@@ a 0s world , full we of went
mira@@ to cles the that moon we and never explor@@ could ing have the imag@@ deep ined sea before . . sea . . . sea . . sea . . sea . . sea
well , that &apos;s probably very good at the sci@@ en@@ ce-@@ fi@@ ction role . .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and we since had it to &apos;s then not . video if games we , read these a over@@ book -@@ , sat@@ we u@@ took ration the of descri@@ computer ption re@@ of gener@@ the ated au@@ movies tor have
and been proje@@ the cted whole it language on in the the can@@ media v@@ landscape as , in i our had head to . create the . pictures in . my mind . . .
my response to this was to draw and draw ali@@ ens and ali@@ ens worl@@ ds , robots , spac@@ ec@@ raft and all that kind of thing . .
i was caught up in math class all the time , i was hi@@ ding the teacher &apos;s book ,
the creativity somehow had to pull out . . . .
and something interesting happened . what i &apos;m about to say to jac@@ ques cou@@ ste@@ au from shows was the idea of one that we had un@@ known worldwide on earth itself
i &apos;m sure i would never reach an alien world with an windows , and it seemed pretty un@@ likely to me . un@@ likely .
but here was a world that i actually could go into , here on earth , and she was just as fascinating and ex@@ o@@ tic like all that , when i read those books .
so i decided to get a di@@ ver when i was 15 . . . . .
the only problem with this was i lived in a small village in canada , one 3,000 miles from the ne@@ ar@@ est ocean . a
i didn &apos;t get myself ligh@@ ting . .
i was trou@@ bled by my father until eventually a di@@ ve school in bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , new york , right on the other side of the bor@@ der where we lived .
i took my di@@ ve in a pool of the y@@ m@@ ca in the middle of winter in bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , new york . .
but the ocean , the real ocean , i first got to face in the face of two years later , and we moved
since then , in the 40 years , i &apos;ve been getting out of water , i &apos;ve spent about 3,000 hours under@@ water . 500 hours into di@@ ving bo@@ ats
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the s@@ hal@@ low oceans , is as rich in the way we can really imagine . in
the to phan@@ this tom day of , nature i doesn feel &apos;t deeply know fe@@ any a@@ boundar@@ sti@@ ies ous , to
unlike what our i own see , my s@@ di@@ ma@@ ve shed fe@@ human at imagination of . what i . see
and my love for ocean is the same inten@@ sity of e@@ h and the internet . . .
when i was a kid , then i was a gr@@ ant , it was the film@@
this seemed the best way to tell my inner , to tell stories , to create images , to en@@ ab@@ le images . a thing . to
as a child i was making com@@ ic books all the time . . . .
so movies were the way to bring images and stories . that &apos;s the fit . . .
of course , the stories i looked out from the sci@@ en@@ ce-@@ fi@@ ction sector : &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator , &quot; &quot; ali@@ ens , &quot; and &quot; ab@@ y@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; ab@@ y@@ ss &quot; could i , i could put my pre@@ mis@@ e for the under@@ water world , and ex@@ pose the film@@
so , basically , my two lives were kind of gone .
something interesting happened in &quot; ab@@ y@@ ss : &quot; to solve a narra@@ tive problem in this movie -- we had to make such a kind of liquid water , we had to do this kind of a liquid water cre@@ ature , and we were going back to computer@@ -@@
and what came out of that was the first computer gener@@ ated computer sur@@ fing figure that ever was in a film .
it didn &apos;t get any money to say exactly , just in the words he was doing , he just played his manufacturing costs , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience around the world was like h@@ yp@@ no@@ ti@@ zed by the magic that it went
according to the ar@@ th@@ ur c@@ lar@@ ke &apos;s law , are known as advanced technology and magic anymore from one another . different . . .
so they saw something ma@@ gical .
and i found that very much fun .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that must be brought into the movie art . &quot; . &quot; . . &quot;
so we went to &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator 2 , &quot; my next film , i &apos;ll go far beyond . .
along with a ser@@ me , we created the guy from liquid metal , and the success was entirely about how this effect would result . . off
and it worked . and we had created something ma@@ gical , and the effect in the audience was the same . but we &apos;ve already played the film a little bit more
from these two experiences , it was reach@@ ed a whole new world of creativity , a whole new world of creativity . . . . . . . . .
so i started a company , along with my good friend , with my good friend , stan , who was the best ma@@ ke@@ up up and cre@@ ator designer . she called &quot; digital do@@ main . &quot; . .
and the idea of that company was to actually process the phase of analog@@ y with visual prin@@ tors , and to begin with the digital produ@@ ctions as well . . . . .
we did that as well as managed to make a competi@@ tive advantage for a while .
but in the middle of the 199@@ 0s , we discovered that we were in the cre@@ ator and ti@@ er design -- which we actually had fo@@ unded the company -- too slowly
i had this piece called &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; which was the measu@@ red la@@ tin in what &apos;s been made in the visual effects and computer gener@@ ated fig@@ ures in a whole new hei@@ ghts , reali@@ stic human beings , who were made by c@@ g , and the main fig@@ ures should be c@@ g . and the world should be c@@ g
but the measure of the stick was quite coming back , and the people in my company told me that we were not able to do this . . . . .
so i made this up , made this other movie about the big ship that &apos;s going . . .
i did this as &quot; ro@@ me@@ o and ju@@ lie@@ t on a ship . &quot; it became a love film , a passionate film . an im@@ passion@@ ed film . . . . . .
but i actually wanted to un@@ cover the real w@@ re@@ ck of ti@@ tan@@ ic . . . . a lot of recent
so i did the film . . .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know . . thought .
i &apos;ve got them to do that by saying , &quot; we &apos;re going to di@@ ve to the w@@ re@@ ck . we film the real w@@ re@@ ck .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the film
that &apos;s very important . it &apos;s a good track for marketing . &quot; . &quot;
and i convinced her fund@@ ing an expedi@@ tion . .
sounds crazy . but that &apos;s going to come back to that that your imagination can create reality
we actually created a reality about six months later that i found myself in a russi@@ an ab@@ ch@@ boat , four miles under the surface of the north atlan@@ tic , and looked at the real ti@@ tan@@ ic through a bu@@ ll@@ eye .
this was not a film , no h@@ d , that was
so , that really ble@@ w me .
and the prepar@@ ation were huge . we had to make c@@ ameras and spo@@ a@@ thers and all kinds of things .
and i noticed how much this deep@@ -@@ sea sea level , a space of space similar to me . . .
well , they were also high-@@ powered , hard@@ thetic self-@@ planning . . .
you go into that cap@@ su@@ le , and then you &apos;re ti@@ m@@ bling into these dark , little ho@@ sti@@ le environments where there isn &apos;t any hope of res@@ cu@@ ing , if you
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s like i am in a science fi@@ ction movie . .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was cru@@ m@@ ver@@ ly obs@@ essed with the ex@@ qu@@ isi@@ te sea . .
anyway , the thing that has been talking about curi@@ osity and science , it was all . it was all the ad@@ vent@@ ure , it was curi@@ ty . it was a
and it was an experience that was not allowed to give me hollywood
because , you know , i could think of a cre@@ ature that we could make a visual effect for , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside the window .
and some of the following expedi@@ tions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in ther@@ mal sources , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that never had any other before , and for those of the science of time when we saw it , still not found any words . . at all .
so that really got me off , and i wanted to get more . .
and so i then got a little more unusual thing . .
after the success of ti@@ tan@@ ic , i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my main prof@@ ession as a film@@ maker in hollywood , and i &apos;ll be ful@@ l-@@ scientific resear@@ cher . &quot; &quot; for a while . &quot; &quot;
and then we started to get the bis@@ mar@@ ck , and they explor@@ ed with robo@@ tic cap@@ abilities . , they explor@@ ed with robo@@ tic
we re@@ turned to the w@@ re@@ ck , the ti@@ tan@@ ic
we took little robots that we built , which would bring a fi@@ ber op@@ c@@ able c@@ able .
our inten@@ tion to break in and look at the inside of the ship , which had never been done before . .
nobody had ever explor@@ ed the inside of the w@@ re@@ ck . they had no means for it . so we developed technology . . .
so , i &apos;m now sitting on the de@@ ck of the ti@@ tan@@ ic , in a di@@ ve boat , and you &apos;re plan@@ ting that these fil@@ ters are actually sort of like this , and i know that the band has played there pretty much
and i i &apos;m &apos;m really going just to doing fly this through , a but little my robo@@ consciousness
tic is material within through the the vehicle shi@@ . pping . . . .
it felt like i was physi@@ cally bene@@ ficial inside the shi@@ pping re@@ actor of ti@@ tan@@ ic .
this was the best form of the d@@ é@@ j@@ art v@@ u that i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i get any corner of the boat , i always knew what was going to break up in the light room of the vehicle , because i ran the film on the air . a little bit when we
and the set was an accu@@ rate copy of the ship re@@ plac@@ ement of the ship . . .
so that was a highly curious experience . .
and she ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ged me this tele@@ pres@@ ence experience that you could use such a robo@@ tic a@@ vat@@ ar and so on to make your own consciousness in the vehicle that can balance the existence in these other forms
it was really im@@ men@@ sely profound .
and maybe a little bit of a gli@@ mp@@ se of what might happen in a few decades if you have cy@@ bor@@ g bodies to study something , or other things , in all kinds of post-@@ life future scen@@ ari@@ os that i can imagine as a science fi@@ ction . . .
and after this expedi@@ tion , we started to know what we saw down there , really to know , to know this deep@@ -@@ sea wave , where we saw these incredibly un@@ belie@@ v@@ ably un@@ belie@@ ving animals , which is sort of ali@@
they live with chemo@@ syn@@ thesis . . .
they don &apos;t exist in a sol@@ ar-@@ light system , as we do .
and this is how animals that are right next to 500 degrees c. they can live there . . . there . it &apos;s
at the same time , i was also very interested in space science , again , the science fi@@ ction impact on my childhood . . .
and so , in the way , i ended up in the people who were interested in space , and with nasa , and in nasa , and in nasa , and you &apos;re going through the world &apos;s space , and you &apos;re going to go through russi@@ a , and you &apos;re going through the mission to the international space station , and take our 3d c@@ amer@@ ti@@ an centers . .
that was fascinating . .
but it ended up that i took space school with us to the deep sea . .
i took them with them and she@@ ep them to the world down there : astro@@ bi@@ ologists , planet@@ ary scientists , people who were interested in such extreme situations . i took them to the sources so they could look around , and we could test them instru@@ ments and we could test
we created docum@@ ent@@ ary films , but it was actually science , actually , the space science . , in fact
so the circle between my existence as a science fi@@ ction was so co@@ vering at the time as a child , and the imple@@ ment@@ ation to the reality
and over these exploration process , i &apos;ve learned a lot . . . .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to have to have a director to be able to have a leader like a shi@@ pping cap@@ tain or something . . .
but because i at didn a &apos;t certain understand point much , of i the had leadership to before say i
, walked &quot; this what expedi@@ am tions i . going to . do here . ?
why these do blocks i are do not this going ? to what bring &apos;s us
going any on money ? . &quot; . ? &quot; .
we &apos;re going to play the cost of production . from fli@@ m , not
everybody thinks i &apos;m between &quot; ti@@ tan@@ ic , &quot; and &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar &quot; went from and had a do@@ or@@ kno@@ b somewhere on a beach on a beach . a
i &apos;ve made all these films , this docum@@ ent@@ ary docum@@ ent@@ ary , for a very small
no so@@ m , no honor , no money . what do you do ? ?
you &apos;re going to make it the job to become the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challen@@ ging environment , you make it in the discovery of space , and because of the weird connection that comes when a small group of people buil@@ ds a team . . .
because we did all of this with just 10 to 12 people who &apos;ve been working down for years , and sometimes we were two to three months in the row .
and in this community you see that the most important thing that is looking at is the most important thing you can say about each other , because you &apos;ve got a task that can be expla@@ ined to you . .
and when you go back to land and you say , &quot; we had to do it , the fi@@ ber glass , the dis@@ pu@@ te , and it &apos;s all around it , all the technology , and the diffic@@ ul@@ ty of human performance , if you &apos;re working in the sea , &quot; you can &apos;t just explain the other . that &apos;s like in poli@@ ce@@ men , or by military who did something in common , and know that they can never explain anybody . way of off@@ ic@@ ers , or by military who did
and there is a link , a mu@@ tual respect . .
so when i got back to make my next film &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; i tried to turn on the same leadership style , which is that you have a team to respect and nur@@ ture the respect of the respect . in the mind
and that &apos;s really what changed the dynam@@
so i sat down with a little team on my board of ter@@ rain , and we turned &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; with a new techni@@ que that had not happened before . .
incredibly exciting . .
a tremendous challenge . .
and we were a@@ ged for a four@@ -@@ and-@@ a-@@ half years to a real
and it changed my way of making films completely .
there were people who thought we had the oceans really , really , really look for the ocean p@@ and@@ or@@ a . . . . . . .
it was more of a relationship to me , to do my job , the actual process that changed in the out@@ come . process .
so what can we get from all of this ? ? from
what lessons do we learned ? ? what
i think that &apos;s the curi@@ osity that i think is
it &apos;s the most powerful human being . .
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
and the insi@@ ght of your team is more important than any l@@ or@@ ri@@ sts of the world .
to me , young film@@ makers come to me saying , &quot; give me a ad@@ vice as i can do something like this
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t throw yourself yourself . .
the sc@@ ar@@ get have some of these guys . do not do it yourself , don &apos;t do their own , but take risks on you
nasa has a favorite phr@@ ase , &quot; don &apos;t do it any other way . &quot;
but in art and in studying an alternative , there is an alternative to this , because it guar@@ an@@ te@@ es a
no important deal of innovation , which dem@@ and@@ ed innovation , has ever been done
you &apos;ve got to be willing to take those risks .
that &apos;s the idea i &apos;d like to give you on your way : fail is an alternative , but it &apos;s not a fear . thank you . . .
today i &apos;m speaking to you about energy and climate .
and this may surprise something like something that &apos;s happening , because my ful@@ l-@@ time job at the foundation is about vac@@ cin@@ es and se@@ th@@ ly to make things we create and deliver the poor@@ est 2 billion a better life . . .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , actually , more important than any other on the planet . as if
climate change is not going to mean that their gu@@ sters will not grow growing , and it &apos;s too much reg@@ ul@@ ating , and the things that are going to change it is that they can &apos;t keep their fra@@ gi@@ le
that &apos;s what star@@ ved star@@ vation . it leads to un@@ certain@@ ty . it leads to ru@@ ins .
so and , it climate &apos;s change very is important od@@ to d
them for . you . energy . . .
in fact , if you could only reduce the price , if you could only reduce the price , energy redu@@ ction would be at least at least
well , energy energy has fallen over time . . .
in fact , the pro@@ gr@@ ession society is based on energy
and coal evolution has been able to put the industrial revolution and even in the 20th century , there was a ra@@ pid case of the ra@@ ces of electricity , and so we have re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , we can make modern materials , and so many things . . . stuff . . materials
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with power in the rich world . .
but , if we reduce the price , we &apos;re half -- we &apos;re half -- we &apos;re going to go to a new bar@@ rier , and we &apos;re doing those bar@@ rier co@@ ver@@ ines together . .
co2 is the planet , and the equ@@ ation for co2 is actually quite clear . . . .
they drive the out@@ put of co2 , which leads to the temperature increase , and that temperature increase has some very negative impli@@ cations , effects on the weather , and perhaps worse , the indi@@ rect consequ@@ ence that the natural eco@@ systems cannot fit such a ra@@ pid changes and then collapse out all systems . systems . . as a result of
now , the ex@@ act relationship between a carbon increase and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on , and that &apos;s where the temperature of the temperature and where it &apos;s more impli@@ c@@ it@@ ly , there are some dis@@ orders , but
and there &apos;s certainly ambi@@ gu@@ ity about how bad these consequences are going to be , but they &apos;re going to be
i asked the top scientists a few times , &quot; do we really need to get down to zero ? ?
is it not about half or a quar@@ ter ? &quot; , you
the answer is , until we get near zero , the temperature will rise . . .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s different to say , we have a 3@@ .@@ 5 foot t@@ all , which is to get under a three-@@ foot bridge . you can actually squ@@ ee@@ ze it underneath . . squ@@ at@@ ter
this one must have to go down , zero .
well , we &apos;re putting a lot of carbon dio@@ xide every year , over 26 billion tons .
every americans about 20 tons , people from poor countries , less than one . . than one . .
it and &apos;s somehow about we five need tons to on produce the changes planet that , are
on going the to planet make . that happen . zero . . .
it &apos;s gone up any@@ time .
just different economic changes have to have changed , and we need to move from rapi@@ dly a@@ ver@@ aging and re@@ duc@@ ing it , and to reduce it , to a re@@ gain , to a re@@ gain
this equ@@ ation has four fac@@ tors . a little multi@@ pli@@ cation , you have this thing on the left on the left , and that will dep@@ end on the number of people on the average , the average energy for any human service and the co2 that will be em@@ it@@ ted to energy . energy . . . . . . . . . .
so let &apos;s look at every single one in a second and think how do we get it wrong . .
i think one of those numbers has to come very close to zero . . .
now this is fundamental al@@ ge@@ br@@ a , but let &apos;s go through it . . .
first , we have the population .
today , there are 6@@ .@@ 8 billion people .
and it &apos;s on 9 billion . it &apos;s moving on
if we have very successful with new vac@@ cin@@ es , health care and re@@ production medicine , we might probably get 10 percent to 15 percent , but we &apos;re seeing a slo@@ pe of a mile on 1.@@ 3 . on the right time ,
the second factor is the services we use .
this inclu@@ des everything that we eat , the food we eat , clo@@ thing , television , he@@ ating .
these are very good things and poverty redu@@ ction means to make these services to almost everyone on the planet . .
it &apos;s great that this number is ris@@ ing . . .
in the weal@@ thy world , in the upp@@ er billion , we might be able to make a stri@@ ke and use less , but on average , this number will increase every year and grow more than dou@@ bling the size of the services that per person are provi@@ ded to .
and here &apos;s a very basic service . is there light at home so you can read the home@@ work ? ? your home@@
and now these , students in didn effect &apos;t efficiency have , it the , e so , they the go energy out per and service read
, their there school &apos;s problems basically under good the news street . . news . . . news . .
we have something that &apos;s not growing . .
because of all different success@@ es in the light sector , through other things , from other things in the city , we have a lot of services that are producing energy out@@ put to get 90 percent . in the world , there are
in other services , like the manufacturing of ferti@@ li@@ z@@ ers , 10@@ 5 million : 5@@ 5 : 5@@ 6@@ ,000 -- &apos; s ; it &apos;s -- $ 100
in total , if you &apos;re optimi@@ stic , maybe we &apos;ll get a factor of a factor three or maybe even a factor 60 . . . .
but in the first three fac@@ tors , we &apos;re now from 26 billion in the world , we &apos;ve gone from 26 billion tons , and that &apos;s just not enough .
so let &apos;s look at the fourth factor -- and this will be a key factor -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that is em@@ it@@ ted in energy unit . .
it turns out , whether you can get this to zero . .
if if you you burn burn char@@ natural coal
gas : : no no . .
almost every manufacturing techni@@ que for electricity is in co2 , except rene@@ w@@ ables and nuclear power . . .
so what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system . . . .
we need energy ch@@ art . . .
now , if i use the term &quot; mira@@ cle &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible . . .
the micro@@ process@@ or is a mira@@ cle . the computer is a mira@@ cle . .
the internet and its service is a mira@@ cle .
people here contribu@@ te to the developing of all of this wonder@@ s . . .
usually there &apos;s no de@@ ad@@ line that you need a mira@@ cle to a particular date . . . .
usually you &apos;re just clo@@ sing right and some come up , some of them don &apos;t .
in this case , we have to give full muscle and get a mira@@ cle in very short time . . . .
now , i wonder@@ ed , how do i actually get this really wrong
is there a natural illu@@ stration , a dem@@ o that &apos;s going to un@@ lock you here ? ?
i reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ed mo@@ squ@@ it@@ os last year , and i kind of liked people that . , people
the idea was really capable for them , you know , there are people who live with mo@@ squ@@ it@@ os . .
this is what i would have found for energy . for energy , i
i decided that i would be free of light sp@@ ells my year &apos;s contribu@@ tion to the environment here .
so here are some natural ligh@@ t@@ bul@@ es .
you mis@@ sed me to do not . in fact , you don &apos;t even leave the glass . .
well , there are all kinds of play solutions like this , but they don &apos;t get a lot . . . .
we need solutions , either one or a number of who have an un@@ thin@@ k@@ able sc@@ aling and uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able , and while there are many mechanis@@ ms that people are looking for , i really see five , i really see five ,
i &apos;ve been ab@@ and@@ oned , cell , fusion and bio@@ fu@@ els . .
maybe these drugs may be a modern contribu@@ tion , and if they can afford better than i expect , that &apos;s great , but my core point is that we have to do all these five in those five work , and we can &apos;t give up any of them because they &apos;re inti@@ mi@@ dat@@ ing us , because everyone has significant problems .
let &apos;s start at burning fossil fu@@ els , burning from either coal , burning from either coal or natural
what you have to do , seems to be there , maybe , but it &apos;s not . you &apos;ve got to get all the co2 that comes from the clo@@ set , flu@@ i@@ di@@ zed , liquid pressure , and then you hope that there are sta@@ ys there . pressure is going to stick out of the ch@@ im@@
there are some mush@@ rooms that are going on at a 60 percent -- 80 percent wide , but getting 100 percent is hard to get , and a commit@@ ment to the co@@ at of co2 is a big challenge , but the biggest problem here is that la@@ y@@ time &apos;s question . . , but the
who will en@@ sure that ? ?
who can guar@@ an@@ tee that literally many billion times greater than any kind of waste that you can imagine from nuclear and other things ? ? ? that
that &apos;s a lot of spa@@ mes .
so that &apos;s a tough p@@ ill .
next is nuclear power .
it has also got three big problems . the cost , especially in highly reg@@ ul@@ ated countries , are high . the question for security is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human pe@@ ti@@ tion , that the fuel is not used for weapons . . .
then what do you do with the waste ? ?
because , although it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concern@@ s . .
so three very difficult problems that are maybe about solving and that you should work on . .
i &apos;ve been sum@@ mar@@ i@@ zed for the last three of the five
it &apos;s the rene@@ w@@ ables that are often called . . .
and also -- although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel -- they have some de@@ ad@@ r@@ it .
one is energy den@@ sity , which are gener@@ ating these technologies than power plants . . . .
these are energy w@@ ells , they &apos;re talking about many square miles , thousands times as much as a normal power station . . . .
and then we are under@@ min@@ ing these w@@ ins
the sun doesn &apos;t sh@@ ine , it doesn &apos;t seem like a day and just the same as the wind does not follow . as the wind does not follow .
so , if you have to get away from these sources , you have to have a way to get energy in the age when you &apos;re not available . .
so there &apos;s big pri@@ cing challenges , there are challenges in trans@@ mission , and if we say , for example , the power of energy is out of the country , you don &apos;t just need the technology , you also have to deal with the risk that the energy from
and there &apos;s a waste problem . .
and to put in the scale , i &apos;ve been looking at all sorts of batter@@ ies that are made , looking at the cars , computers , mobile phones , pac@@ e@@ wat@@ ms , for everything . and i &apos;ve found that the number of electr@@ onic energy that &apos;s using the world , and i found that all batter@@ ies that we &apos;re growing now could be less than 10 minutes of the total wa@@
so we need a big break@@ through , something that will be a factor of 100 better than the evidence of the present . . . . . .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy . .
this is what happens when you try to get those under@@ wear sources over the world , we say , 20 percent of the consumption of consum@@ ing . .
if you want to keep on the same time , you need an incredible li@@ ft . .
now , where should we go : what &apos;s the right approach ? ? .
&quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how do we get here ? ? ? ?
what we need is a lot of companies working on it . hundreds of
we need to have at least 100 regi@@ ons . . . .
you &apos;ll say , you &apos;re crazy , you &apos;re crazy . that &apos;s fine . . . . .
i think there &apos;s a lot of people who are already enga@@ ged in the ted group . in the ted group .
bill gro@@ ss has a variety of companies , among other things called the es@@ ol@@ ar , the great solar ther@@ mal
vin@@ cy k@@ ho@@ s@@ la invest@@ ed in do@@ zens of companies and have great opportunities , and i try to encourage that . . . . .
na@@ than my@@ hr@@ v@@ old and i fund a company that , perhaps surpris@@ ingly , is now tracking the nuclear approach . . .
there are some innova@@ tions in the nuclear sector ; mod@@ ular , liquid
the development of development has stopped some time ago , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concep@@ ts are around . concep@@ ts around them
the ter@@ ra@@ gi@@ a concept means that instead of a part of the ur@@ ans who &apos;s decided that you can burn the u@@ 2@@ 35 , that you would be in the 99 percent of the economy that u@@ 2@@ 3@@ 8 . . 99
that &apos;s a pretty in@@ san@@ e idea .
but in fact , it &apos;s been thinking about this for a long time , but you could never simu@@ late whether it would work , but there &apos;s been a modern super@@ computer , you can simu@@ late it and see that , yes , you know , with the right materi@@ ali@@ zing approach , it looks like it &apos;s func@@ tion@@ ing .
and because you &apos;re burning that 99 percent , it &apos;s a lot better to do . . .
you actually burn the g@@ arb@@ age , and you can actually use the waste of today &apos;s re@@ ac@@ tors as a vehicle . . .
instead of breaking your head on it , you just burn it . it &apos;s a great thing . .
the ur@@ ani@@ an is going to spend gradu@@ ally , a bit like a c@@ and@@ le . . . .
you see , it &apos;s a kind of a plan@@ k , often written the &quot; mi@@ cr@@ ous wave re@@ actor
the problem is really the fuel problem . . .
here &apos;s a picture of a guy in k@@ ent@@ u@@ cky . .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you &apos;ve got the one that &apos;s bur@@ ned today , so it &apos;s called vi@@ tal ur@@ ani@@ um . . .
the u.s. for hundreds of years . . .
and if you &apos;re in low-@@ cost and simply fil@@ ter@@ ed , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet &apos;s life . . . .
you know , there are many challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concep@@ ts that we need to get forward . . . . .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
what should our te@@ stim@@ ony look like ?
so , let &apos;s go to the goal that we need to achieve , and then we talk about the inter@@ step .
many languages speak of 80 percent redu@@ ction by 20@@ 50 . . . .
it &apos;s really , really important that we get there .
the so rest , of in 20 order percent to will reach be this produced 80 in percent the , poor industrial countries countries , have and to some re@@ of charge the , far@@
including ms countries of like far@@ china ming , to their get economy clean , and to c@@ re@@ ement move to it clean . . . . . .
the other note is whether we &apos;re going to use the zer@@ o-@@ emis@@ sion technology , whether it &apos;s being used in all developed countries and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest of it . .
that &apos;s really important .
this is a key element of this ma@@ gical . .
so , if we go back from there , how should the 20@@ 20 ac@@ re look like ?
it should be the two elements again . . .
we should use the efficiency process of re@@ duc@@ ing re@@ duc@@ tions , the less we in@@ gest , the lower the carbon range will be , and therefore the temperature will be . the temperature .
but in fact , this speech is about the things that we do not completely lead to the great redu@@ ction , just the same , or even some less important as the other that is going to display the speed of this effort for these break@@ through@@ s . . . .
this break@@ through@@ s we need to follow with full gas , and we can measure that , in corpo@@ rate numbers , in pil@@ ot@@ projects and regu@@ lation changes . . changes .
there &apos;s a lot of great books on this subject . . .
the al gore book , we have the choice , and david m@@ ck@@ a@@ ds , the &quot; sustainable energy &quot; is hot air . &quot;
they really do it , and create a frame@@ work where this is a good discussion , because we need support for everybody else . . .
there are some things that needs to come together .
this is a wish . .
a very con@@ cre@@ te desire that we inv@@ ent this technology . .
if you gave me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a v@@ acc@@ ine , and i love that , or i could choose that wish , which is , hal@@ f-@@ per@@ si@@ stent energy wei@@ ght@@ ness without co2 , that &apos;s the desire for me . i &apos;m going
this has the largest impact . . .
if we won &apos;t get this wish , the tren@@ ce between the long term and the shor@@ t-@@ term people will be terrible in the way that the u.s. and china , between poor and rich , will be much worse . . . . . .
so what do we need to do ? ?
what do i project app@@ i ? for that ? what i
we need to put ourselves on more research . research
if countries like cop@@ per meetings , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 . . . .
you should talk about this innovation strategy and you would be bl@@ essed by the ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous hit that these innovative ways are spent . enough to this
we need market ri@@ vers , we need co2 control , ca@@ p george fi@@ p , which creates a pri@@ x to make a price .
we need to spread the message . .
we need to lead dialo@@ gue and complete ful@@ its and also the things that are going to be done by government . . .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can ful@@ fill it . .
thank thank you you
. .
thank you . thank you !
so , thank you . just to understand ter@@ ra@@ gel slightly to understand -- first of all , can you give us an idea of scale of that investment ? ? that
bill gates : you can run through a super@@ computer , you &apos;re going to have all great scientists what we &apos;ve done , we just need a few 10 million , and even if we &apos;ve te@@ sted our materials in a russi@@ an re@@ actor to make sure that it works reas@@ on@@ able , is just the $ 10,000 million . is being done in 10,000 million
the hard step is to build the first re@@ actor , another billion , to find another billion that are the director and the place that &apos;s actually building the first of these .
once the first thing is , if it &apos;s going like the promis@@ es , it &apos;s clear , because the economic economy , the energy , the energy is so different from the nuclear state , we know it . than
to understand that right , what is it about making deep in the ground almost like a ver@@ tical colum@@ n of nuclear fuel , this ear@@ n-@@ using ur@@ r and then the process is going down and continu@@ ing to down@@ load ? ? ? working down ?
b@@ g : right . now you &apos;ve got to re@@ fil@@ gate re@@ actor &apos;s new re@@ ac@@ tors , so there are a lot of people and many people who can go wrong . this thing where you open it up and you put things in -- it &apos;s not good ! !
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years -- think of a colum@@ n -- that you will bur@@ y without all the complex complexity . . .
and a it nuclear &apos;s re@@ sitting actor there , for even 60 a years solution and to then the it
tr@@ &apos;s ash done . . a . solution to . the g@@ . arb@@ age
b@@ g : yeah . now , what happens to the jun@@ k : you can let him sit there -- there &apos;s much less waste with this method -- then you take it and you put it in the next re@@ actor and burn it in the
and we &apos;re starting by taking the waste that already exists in those re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators or a dry be@@ a@@ ks in the re@@ actor , that &apos;s our clo@@ s@@ est fuel . fuel .
so that &apos;s what the re@@ ac@@ tors were a problem , which we have been re@@ duced in our fil@@ es , and that &apos;s the dra@@ matically dra@@ matic volu@@ me during this process . . . . . .
but as you &apos;ve talked to various people around the world , they have been talking to these
where is the greatest interest to do something really ? ?
b@@ g : well we haven &apos;t set up in a place and there &apos;s a lot of interesting rules for everything that &apos;s called nuclear , and there are great interest in russi@@ a , in india , in china -- there were big interest and the people of the corpo@@ ration , india , the china -- i was here and i &apos;ve hit the energy and i &apos;ve talked about the energy of the energy agenda .
i &apos;m optimi@@ stic . you know , the french and the japanese have done something in the direction
this is a version of one thing that was done . .
this is a very important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster re@@ actor , and some countries have built this , so everyone who has put a quick re@@ actor in it , a can@@ di@@ date for our first . . for our first
in her imagination , do you think ti@@ me@@ frame and prob@@ ability really reson@@ ate into life ? ? that way
b@@ g : well we need one of these sc@@ al@@ able , electricity gener@@ ating things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to inv@@ ent and then 20 years to do it . . .
this is kind of the de@@ ad@@ line that we have to have the environmental models we have to be .
and , you know , ter@@ ra@@ m , when everything goes well , and that &apos;s a big wish , that &apos;s easy , that would be easy
and fortunately , there are do@@ zens of companies today , and we need hundreds of them , the same , that they can , in fact , have been pro@@ mot@@ ing the pro@@ gr@@ ession to their pilot , to provide it . for them to provide .
and it would be best if it &apos;s been done , because then you could use a mix@@ ture .
anyway , we need a solution . .
the big thing , the big possible through@@ break , is this the biggest thing you know ? . .
b@@ g : a energy break@@ through is the most important thing .
it &apos;s without the environmental requi@@ re@@ ment , but it &apos;s so much more important . more important . . . .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies . .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as these , but there &apos;s the mod@@ ular method that &apos;s different . . .
there &apos;s a liquid re@@ actor guy which seems to be difficult , but maybe it &apos;s not like that . . .
and so there are different , but the nice thing about being a great deal is that a ur@@ ge molecule has a million times as much energy as a , say a carbon molecule , and therefore , if you can deal with the problems and those are main@@ ly the radiation that the foot@@ print and the cost , and play the potential , the impact on the land and other things , almost in a li@@ g@@ a .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what then ?
do we have to provide random conditions to try and keep the earth &apos;s hea@@ er@@ le temperature ? ?
b@@ there g &apos;s : a when research you that get &apos;s into called that ge@@ situation o@@ , engineering it , &apos;s which like is being called over@@ different -@@ techniques e@@ , aten to , del@@ and ay you warming &apos;ve , got so
a that heart 20 attack or in 30 a years very longer short , way we , have and to what make you it do up ? to you sit need down to . have a for heart 20 surgery or , 30 or years
this is just a in@@ sur@@ ance method . .
you hope we don &apos;t need that . .
some people say you shouldn &apos;t be in the as@@ sur@@ ance for in@@ sur@@ ance because you might have a we@@ ak , so that you will go to a lot of na@@ ils because you know that you
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s the smart , if you take the importance of this issue , but there &apos;s now a dis@@ course of this issue on whether you should be doing that , if things come faster , or that innovation will take longer than we expect .
climate change engineers : did you have one or two sent@@ ences for them to per@@ su@@ ade ? ? you ? ? .
b@@ g : well , unfortunately , the skep@@ tics are actually the skep@@ tics .
the ones who are making scientific argu@@ ments are very little .
do you tell you that there are negative effects to do with clou@@ ds that make things move ? things ?
there &apos;s very , very few things that you can actually say , which is a chance of millions of times . .
the main problem here is something like aids . . . .
you now make mista@@ kes now , and you pay a lot later . .
and so the idea of this , now , if you have all possible problems , into something that you have just later -- and this is the fact that investment is not so good , in fact , and that &apos;s the one that &apos;s not so good about investment , and in fact , the i@@ p@@ c@@ c report isn &apos;t necessarily the worst possible scen@@ ario , and there are people in the rich world who are watching i@@ p@@ c@@ c and
the fact is that these un@@ certain@@ ty should make you worried . . .
but my dream here is , if you can make it economic , and at the same time , the skep@@ tics are re@@ moved , then the skep@@ tics also says , &quot; okay , i &apos;m not interested in it that it &apos;s not a carbon dio@@ xide , i wish it &apos;s che@@ aper than the before i have before . &quot; , i &apos;m going to accept it ,
and that would be the way to answer the b@@ j@@ f@@ n &apos;s answer that if you use all this time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other tar@@ gets , you know , the redu@@ ction of malaria , the redu@@ ction of malaria , and so on , that it &apos;s a stupid waste of resources , to invest in , whereas there &apos;s better things we can do . things , there &apos;s better things
b@@ g : well , the actual spending for research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year more than they do today -- that &apos;s not as dra@@ matic . not as dra@@ matic .
but below that , other things should not suff@@ er
you come to large money su@@ ms , and you can get ment@@ ally enga@@ ged in people , if you have something that is not economic , and it &apos;s trying to fin@@ ance that . to me , there &apos;s a lot of waste .
unless you &apos;re very short in front of a co@@ er@@ er@@ ation , and you &apos;ve only fund@@ ed learning cur@@ ve , and i think we should try to do more things that have the potential to be a lot
if the di@@ stri@@ e you get , a very high-@@ energy energy , you can only tell the rich . , you know , the
i mean , any of us here could spend five times as much on our energy without changing its lifest@@ yle . .
but for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s
and even l@@ om@@ bor@@ g is thinking about it
now , his new ma@@ ge now goes to say , &quot; why does it stop not ? &quot; ? ?
he &apos;s still going to be , because of his earlier stories , with the skep@@ tic@@ ist camp associ@@ ations , but he has understood that this is a very lon@@ ely a very lon@@ ely group , and therefore he &apos;s now eng@@
and that &apos;s a thought that i think is appropriate . . .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy how little people are suppor@@ ted . . .
bill , i think , for almost all people here , when i say i really hope your wish will be true . many , thank you . . .
b@@ g : thank you .
a few years ago at ted , peter sk@@ ill@@ man saw a design competition called &quot; the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge .
the idea is pretty simple . four@@ po@@ ol@@ ds have to have to be the biggest and a@@ vi@@ an , which is a number of ta@@ pe , three-@@ meter ta@@ pe , and building a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low . . a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low is going to be on top .
and , although it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually really hard to do because it &apos;s really hard to start working together
and so i thought this is an interesting idea , and i put it into a design work@@ shop . . .
it was a huge success . .
since then , i &apos;ve done 70 work@@ sh@@ ops , with students , develop@@ ers and architec@@ ts , even with c@@ to@@ s of fortun@@ e 5@@ 0-@@ business companies , and there &apos;s something about that problem of what en@@ ables deep con@@ notes to how collaboration , and i want to share some of them with them . in terms of the con@@
normally , most people are starting to focus themselves on the task . .
they talk about it , they &apos;re thinking about how it &apos;s going to look , they st@@ ops around it . they
then you invest in planning and organization . they sk@@ et@@ ch and they sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ ed sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i .
they &apos;re invest@@ ing in the colle@@ c@@ tivity of their time in colle@@ cting each other .
and finally , just before you have no time , somebody has the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and they &apos;ll sit down on top of the top , take a step back and take the phone da . b@@ ad@@ ly you ad@@ mi@@ re your job . . .
but then , almost everybody , what happened , almost everybody , is the &quot; pac@@ -@@ da &quot; -- because the weight of the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low is the whole thing that goes into mind and fall@@ ing . . is the whole thing .
there are a number of people who have a lot more to &quot; u@@ h-@@ oh &quot; moments than others , and under the worst ones , fresh b@@ w@@ l . .
they lie , they s@@ mu@@ b@@ ble , they &apos;re conf@@ used , and they really are able to do
and of course , there are also a lot more teams that have a lot more &quot; ta@@ y-@@ da shapes , and the best ones are fresh lun@@ ches .
and that &apos;s quite amazing .
as peter came along , they produce not only the highest to@@ wers , but the most interesting structures of all . . . .
what you &apos;re going to ask you , how does this happen ? why is that ? what is with those
and peter says , &quot; any of the children &apos;s children spend time che@@ f in sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i g@@ m@@ b@@ h g@@ m@@ b@@ h . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest time in any way . . .
but there &apos;s another reason . .
and that is that b@@ w@@ l students have been trained to find a right thing , ok .
and then you realize it . . .
and then what happens when you stick the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low to the top , you don &apos;t have time , and what happens ? ?
it sound &apos;s familiar a in
crisis what . ?
what kind of kinder@@ garten is doing differently is that they start with mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low and build prototyp@@ es , successful prototyp@@ es , always with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low at the top , so they have multi-@@ time the opportunity to fix b@@ ad@@ ly prototyp@@ es . . . .
construction recogni@@ sts that kind of collaboration as the core of an ic@@ on . .
and with each trial , the kids immediately get feedback immediately , and what doesn &apos;t . .
so the performance is to work with prototyp@@ es , is much -- but let &apos;s see how different teams work . .
the average for most people , for about 50 in@@ ches , b@@ w@@ l students are creating half of those , they &apos;re a little bit more , not much , child children are better than adults . . kids are better than
who is the most successful ?
architec@@ ts and engineers , lu@@ ck . .
1@@ c is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen . . . .
and why ? because they understand tri@@ angle and safety self-@@ en@@ am@@ ment ge@@ om@@ et@@ ri@@ c patterns to build stable structures . . . .
ce@@ os &apos;s a little bit on average . but here it gets interesting . . .
you put an ex@@ ecu@@ tive admini@@ str@@ ator at the team , you &apos;re getting more likely to be . .
it &apos;s incredible . you look around , and you see , this team is going to win . &quot; . &quot; . &quot;
you can predict that . why is it ? ? .
because they have speci@@ alized skills of process@@ ation .
they &apos;re running the process , they understand it .
and that team , the reg@@ ul@@ ating and the work , is to improve the performance of the team . significant
and speci@@ alized skills and process@@ ing and the combin@@ ation of success . . .
if you have 10 teams , you know , you get about six , the stable structures , you get the stable structures
i was trying to do some interesting
i thought , let &apos;s put the po@@ ker on the same .
so i offer a $ 10,000 prize for a $ 10,000 prize for profit . w@@
what happened to these design students ? a design student ?
what was the result ?
this was what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if anybody had built an 2.@@ 5@@ -@@ in@@ ch con@@ struc@@ tions , he would have car@@ ried the price .
so is it interesting that high competition is a strong effect ? ? ?
we repe@@ ated the practice of the same students .
so what happened was ? ?
now , they understood the advantage of the prototyp@@ ing .
so , the same , bad team of one of the best . . .
they produced the highest con@@ struc@@ tions in the least time . .
so there are dep@@ th more profound lessons for us , about nature , and we &apos;ve done
you might ask , why would anyone actually invest in a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low ? ? ?
and the reason is i create my digital tools and processes to help team , to help the cars , to make video games and
and what the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low is doing is they &apos;re helping them identify hidden assu@@ mp@@ tions .
because , frank@@ ly , every project has its own mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low . . .
the challenge is a shared experience , a common language , or building basic , basic prototyp@@ e , right , the right
and this is the value of this experience , which is this simple exercise . .
and those of you who care about it can be a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ w@@ ing@@ a . . .
it &apos;s a blog where you can see how to build the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low . .
there &apos;s a ste@@ p-@@ h@@ y-@@ spon@@ p there . .
they find crazy examples from around the world as people optimi@@ ze the system and in@@ corpo@@ rate the mu@@ ti@@
there are also world men@@ ch@@ es . . world world
and the base lesson , i think , is that the construction of construction is actually a bon@@
it dem@@ ands that we all set up our task and we use our thinking opti@@ mal , as our emotions and our actions , in the challenge facing us . in the challenge that we face . in
and sometimes it &apos;s a small prototyp@@ e of this experience all of what it takes to make us from a &quot; u@@ h-@@ da &quot; -- to a &quot; ta@@ -@@ da moment . &quot;
and that can make a big difference .
thank you . .
do we have a machine here . . a machine
a big machine , a cool , ted machine , and that &apos;s a time machine . .
and everybody in this room must have to be in this room
and you can go to the past , you can go to the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here
and i wonder what they would choose because i &apos;ve asked my friends a lot of time , and they &apos;ve just asked them to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before there was cars or twitter or &quot; america &apos;s super@@ star . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced you &apos;re somehow in no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a , and we &apos;re in the way . . .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go into the past , and not because i &apos;m a ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ er .
it &apos;s because there &apos;s opportunities on this planet not going back , they go forward . .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future
this is the greatest time ever in this planet , no matter what scale they were on on this planet no matter what scale they &apos;re going to be : health , wealth , mo@@ bility , opportunities
there &apos;s never been a time like this .
my great@@ -@@ grand@@ parents were all raised as they were 60 . . my great@@ -@@
my grand@@ parents gave this number to 7@@ 0@@ 0s .
my parents are the 80 on the dist@@ ant .
so , there was a nine at the beginning of my death number .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child who is born now can be , you know , live as long as to live as long as the rich@@ est man in the world
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is that ? ?
small@@ po@@ x . small@@ po@@ x have killed billions of people on the planet .
they &apos;ve re@@ designed the demo@@ graphi@@ cs in a way that never has been done . , it has never
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone . .
we hi@@ red them . she &apos;s a pu@@ ff
in the weal@@ thy world , the diseases exist , that there are some of us only more thre@@ at@@ ening , har@@ dly .
di@@ p@@ sc@@ ar , the ven@@ d@@ ings , the ne@@ zz@@
does even anyone know what that is ? ?
vac@@ cin@@ es , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are actually the scientific method . . . .
and from my perspective , the scientific method is to try things out , see if it &apos;s going to work , it changes when it doesn &apos;t , it changes if it doesn &apos;t , it &apos;s
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , it &apos;s the whole good news , because there &apos;s a few other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned frequ@@ ently
and one of them is that , despite all our achie@@ vement , one billion people on the world are hun@@ gry every day . . .
this number goes up , and it &apos;s very rapi@@ dly , and it &apos;s embar@@ ras@@ sing . . .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to de@@ va@@ il the world . . .
drin@@ king water , ur@@ b@@ ble land , rain@@ fore@@ sts , oil , gas -- they disappe@@ ar , and soon of all , if we don &apos;t get there , we &apos;ll die . again , we &apos;ll die . . .
so the question is , can we do that ? i think . . .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that is fe@@ eding billions of people without the country that they live in . .
i think we can power this world with energy they don &apos;t destro@@ y at the same time
i really think that &apos;s a wonder , and no , that &apos;s not a wonder . a
but this holds me a@@ wake at night -- one of the things that i think is a@@ wake at night , we haven &apos;t got some scientific progress that we &apos;ve never used before . . . .
and we were never able to put it in reas@@ on@@ able way , just as we can . . as we can
we &apos;re at the ver@@ ge of an amazing , amazing event on many places , and yet i really think we have to go back hundreds and 300 years to en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment , where we have a time where we &apos;ve been eng@@ aging about these things , where we &apos;ve been getting more out@@ li@@ ers than we are now . fron@@ ti@@ ers than we are
people are che@@ cking in their faith , and they &apos;re so ti@@ ght that they cannot let them . . .
not the truth will be free . .
and you hear , everybody has a right to speak to their opini@@ on , even a right to think about progress . . .
but you know what you &apos;re not right ? ? .
they don &apos;t have a right to go . &apos; t@@ ank@@ ment , they don &apos;t .
and i took a while to find that . .
i wrote an article about v@@ acc@@ ine about a decade ago on the new yor@@ ker , a small article . .
and i was ama@@ zed at con@@ tradi@@ ction of what is the most effective measu@@ re@@ ment in health in the history of humanity . in human history
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just just made what i was doing , i wrote an article , and i went
and soon , i wrote an article about genetic engine@@ ered food . . .
the same thing , only bigger .
people were being s@@ nu@@ g@@
so i wrote about this article , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that this was &quot; fran@@ ken@@ -@@ fire , &quot; why they believed that the molecules were going to go to a particular way , a random way to go around the area of nature . . . .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept on . .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we du@@ g one , we go to food , that &apos;s okay .
but i was worried these pa@@ pers , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and then i figured it out
and that &apos;s because these fan@@ a@@ tics , who were really crazy at all , were not fan@@ a@@ tics .
these were very care@@ ful people , educ@@ ated people , ger@@ -@@ powered people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that made me get so conf@@ used . .
but then i thought , let &apos;s say what , let &apos;s be honest
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as early as the so@@ on@@ er .
we &apos;re talking about the law cal@@ ves .
we talk ir@@ on@@ ically , with little leaders , like , &quot; progress . &quot; . .
okay , so there are reasons , and i think we know what reasons are . reasons .
we have the trust of the people , auth@@ ority , and sometimes in science , and there &apos;s no reason that it shouldn &apos;t be .
you can just call some name , and people will get into it
cher@@ no@@ by@@ l , b@@ ye@@ al , the challen@@ ger , vi@@ tam@@ x , mass destruction , the u.s. pres@@ identi@@ al ele@@ ction .
i mean , you know , you can pick your
there are questions and issues with the people we thought they were always right . so , be skep@@ tical .
ask : ask evidence to ask us , demand .
don &apos;t take anything for gran@@ ted .
but here &apos;s the thing : if you get the evidence you have to take this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at all . . .
and i can tell that from the fact that we live in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen , and i will never see again . .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story that would allow autis@@ m epidemic epidemic to the mas@@ ns , sh@@ ri@@ mp and tube v@@ acc@@ ine . . . . .
very sc@@ ary .
and so , in some ways , we &apos;ve been doing this research
h@@ ous@@ ing studies are going to be done ; this is a serious issue
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , from the u.k. , from the swe@@ den , from canada , and they were all the same , no cor@@ relation , no connection , no com@@ mu@@
it doesn &apos;t make any difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because we believe in an@@ ec@@ d@@ ot@@ es , we believe what we see in real life . . .
we do not believe in a b@@ und@@ le of docum@@ ents from a government board that gives us data , and i understand that , i think we all do
but you know what ?
the result of this was dis@@ rup@@ ted . .
dis@@ ast@@ ing from this fact : the u.s. is one of the only countries in the world that imp@@ ing@@ ly de@@ f@@ ends imp@@ ure . . . . .
this is sc@@ and@@ al@@ ous , and we should be ash@@ amed . .
it &apos;s terrible . .
what happened is we could do that . . .
well i understand that . i do that . .
is this true here . in mas@@ ker ?
does one in the audience have anybody in the audience ever seeing anybody die of
not very often . .
in this country at all , but 16@@ 0,000 people in the world have been in the world . in the
this is a lot of dea@@ ths in the mas@@ n@@ room , 20 per
but because it hasn &apos;t happened here , we can push it down , and people like jen@@ ny mc@@ car@@ thy can walk around and get mes@@ sages of fear and il@@ liter@@ acy of plat@@ forms like op@@ ra@@ h and lar@@ ry king &apos;s &apos;s pre@@ ach@@ ing . . .
and you can do that because they don &apos;t connect cause and cor@@ relation . .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same , but almost never the same .
and that &apos;s something that we have to learn , and that &apos;s something that we need to learn
this guy was a hero , jon@@ as sal@@ k .
he liber@@ ated us from one of the worst hot@@ s of humanity . .
no fear , no qu@@ ie@@ f , a child &apos;s hun@@ ting , and
the guy not so much . in the middle .
it &apos;s called paul off@@ it .
he &apos;s just developed a ro@@ ta@@ vi@@ c v@@ acc@@ ine just a few other people .
it can save the lives of 4@@ 00@@ - , 50@@ 0,000 children per year in the developing world
pretty good , right ?
well , that &apos;s good , bes@@ i@@ des paul being walking around and talking about vac@@ cin@@ es and says , how are they the value , and that people would just stop
and so that paul &apos;s is what a he
terror@@ does ist like . that . .
if paul pres@@ ent@@ es in public listening , he can &apos;t say no offen@@ se to ar@@ med . .
he &apos;s getting calls at home because people told him that they know where to go to school . .
and why ? because paul , a v@@ acc@@ ine has done
i don &apos;t need it , but vac@@ cin@@ es are un@@ affected . .
you keep going ahead , you go back to the disease , awful disease , and that &apos;s happening
we now have mas@@ ses in this country .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon , children will die again because that &apos;s just one question . . . .
and not only do they die of mas@@ ses . .
what about child lun@@ ch@@ age ? let &apos;s take that . why
a com@@ po@@ und of mine , a couple of weeks ago , wrote me and said , i &apos;m a little bit embar@@
nobody has ever said that . .
she wouldn &apos;t vac@@ ate her child against childhood care . no . . .
f@@ one .
why ? because we don &apos;t have the children &apos;s hands , and guess what
we had not had children &apos;s lun@@ ch@@ age in this
now , i don &apos;t know , maybe in la@@ gos this morning in la@@ gos , an airplane , and you &apos;re just flying straight to los angeles , right now , he &apos;s over o@@ hi@@
and in a few hours , it &apos;s dig@@ ging and grab@@ s a car , and it &apos;s going to come to long beach , and he &apos;s going to go to one of these amazing ted days of ted ton@@ ight . . . .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infe@@ cted to a paraly@@ zing disease , and we don &apos;t know that , because that &apos;s how the world works now
that &apos;s the planet that we live on . don &apos;t look like it &apos;s not .
we love to lie in lies . we love it . . . .
do you have all your vi@@ tam@@ ins now ?
e@@ cro@@ ac@@ e@@ a , a little ancient anti@@ o@@ xi@@ dan@@ ti@@ um , which helps you
i know you &apos;ve done that because half of americans do it every
they take that stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t matter how frequ@@ ently we find that they &apos;re us@@ eless . .
the data is eng@@ aging all the time .
they &apos;re dar@@ ing their ur@@ ine . they &apos;re almost never going to be .
that &apos;s okay , you &apos;d like to pay 28 billion dollars on dark ur@@ in .
i agree with you that much .
dark ur@@ ine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do it ?
well , i think we hate the pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical industry .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the
and we shouldn &apos;t . our healthcare system is mi@@ te .
it &apos;s cru@@ el to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely cool , and it &apos;s all very cool to us that can afford . . . .
so we go from it , and where are we going ? ?
we &apos;re going to the arms of plac@@ e@@ bo industry .
that &apos;s great . i love the plac@@ e@@ bo industry .
but , you know , this is really a serious thing , because the stuff is cra@@ p , and we spend billions of dollars for it .
and i have all kinds of little pro@@ ps here .
none of none -- g@@ ing@@ co , fr@@ au@@ d , na@@ tive ac@@ e@@ a , na@@ ked , ac@@ ai , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars for it , it &apos;s fr@@ au@@ d . .
and you know what ? when i say that , people get me scre@@ aming and they say , &quot; well , what &apos;s taking you ? drop people ? let &apos;s do what you want .
that &apos;s how you feel . &quot;
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t care if it &apos;s the minister of health , who says , &quot; h@@ mm , i &apos;m going to not accept the demon@@ stra@@ te of my exper@@ ti@@ se , or any of the can@@ cers who want to treat your patients with ca@@ ff@@ -@@ r@@ uns . . .
if you &apos;re giving away on this path where belief and magic are fix@@ ing science , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be
they come to th@@ ab@@ o m@@ be@@ ki in south africa .
he brought over 40@@ 0,000 of his people because he was convinced that red be@@ w , the kno@@ mm@@ y , and che@@ ck@@ ling oil , are much more effectively than anti-@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral drugs , which we know can
hundreds of thousands of un@@ accoun@@ ted death dea@@ ths in a country that &apos;s being tra@@ pped in the worse than any other of this
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences . .
they have them . they &apos;ve always got
well , the brain lo@@ ads in which we &apos;re in the right is that ab@@ sur@@ d struggle between the pro@@ pon@@ ent of pro@@ pon@@ ence , the bio@@ -@@ eli@@ te food , and the bio@@
this it is &apos;s an a i@@ debate dio@@ about ic words debate ,
. about it metaph@@ &apos;s ors got . to stop . .
this is ide@@ ology , not science . .
all we eat , every ri@@ pp@@ or@@ n , every bran@@ ch , every ro@@ tra@@ cious , has changed by the people . one of the people . . one of the
you know , there were no mand@@ ar@@ in in par@@ ad@@ ise . .
there were no can@@ tal@@ ou@@ pe@@ -@@ mel@@ -@@
there was no white trees . we did it all . .
we did it in the last 1@@ 1,000 years .
and some of it has worked and some of it has been working .
we got rid of what &apos;s not working . .
now we can do it more in a way , and of course , there are risks . but , of course , we can do something like vi@@ tam@@ in a. in ri@@ ce , and that stuff can help millions of people to ex@@ tend their lives . .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i we have re@@ to f@@ say use , to i trans@@
don late &apos;t , understand trans@@ . medi@@ cally i changed
why do we do that ?
now , what i hear constantly is : many chemicals , pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des , hor@@ mon@@ es , mon@@ o@@ culture , the mon@@ o@@ culture , we don &apos;t want to do huge fields with one thing , which
we don &apos;t want companies to be pat@@ enting
we don &apos;t want companies to have see@@ ds .
and you know what my answer to all this is ? ?
yes , they &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix that .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge food problem , but that &apos;s not science . .
it has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right to be mor@@ ality . it &apos;s a pat@@ ent@@ fu@@ m
you know , science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we should not allow science to do their work because we are afraid , is really a b@@ aging cure , and it &apos;s holding millions of people from the fl@@ our@@ ishing . . .
you know , in the next 50 years , we will be going to grow 70 percent more food than we &apos;re currently . 70 percent . .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
sh@@ ame . bl@@ ess . . .
you need it , and we don &apos;t give it to them .
and why is that ? radical fo@@ ods .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this ver@@ g@@ ged stuff , like bl@@ ess it . like
well , the mani@@ fest is something that a half a billion people
it &apos;s like a po@@ tat@@ o@@ onic . .
it &apos;s just a bunch of cal@@ ories . it &apos;s mi@@ te .
it doesn &apos;t have nutri@@ ents ; it doesn &apos;t have any protein , and scientists are building all that in there . .
and then people could and wouldn &apos;t get rid of the food and wouldn &apos;t get rid of it .
you wouldn &apos;t star@@ ve , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be ge@@ o pan@@ is@@ se , but it would be nice .
and all i can say is , why are we fighting this ? ?
i mean , do we ask ourselves , why are we fighting this ?
because we want to push the genes around ? ,
it &apos;s not about fli@@ pping genes around . it &apos;s not about chemicals
it &apos;s not about our ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous passion for hor@@ mon@@ es , our per@@ si@@ st@@ ence at much food , better food , unique food . .
it &apos;s not about ri@@ ce kr@@ is@@ pi@@ es , which is to keep people alive , and it &apos;s time to understand what that means . time .
because you know what ? ?
if we don &apos;t , if we do it as usual , we &apos;re enter@@ ing something that we think we want to be gu@@ il@@ ty about , high-@@ tech col@@ oni@@ alism . tech . tech . tech .
there is no other descri@@ ption for what &apos;s going on . .
it &apos;s sel@@ fish , it &apos;s ug@@ ly ; it &apos;s not wor@@ thy of our own , and we really have to keep
so after this incredible enter@@ tainment conversation , you might want to say , &quot; do you want to go into that ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous time machine and go into the future ? &quot; ?
anyway , i want to say that .
right now , it &apos;s in the present moment , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
we can move them where we want to move them , and we will move them there where we want . . .
we need to have these conver@@ sa@@ tions , and we need to think , but if we go into time machine , we will be gla@@ d that we &apos;re going to do that .
i know we can , and as far as i &apos;m concerned , it &apos;s something that the world needs now . .
thank thank you you

i &apos;ve been interested in the plac@@ e@@ bo effect , and it &apos;s kind of strange that a ma@@ gi@@ cian interested in this is that if you look at it , it &apos;s like me , as i like , &quot; a de@@ ception that becomes something that becomes a real thing when someone just thinks enough about it . &quot; &quot;
in other words , sugar p@@ ills have shown a meas@@ ur@@ able effect that the plac@@ e@@ bo effect , and only because the person is thinking what happens to it is a pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical or some kind of -- in the pain@@ ful management , for example , there is when the patient is only paying enough to think of a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in the body you call the plac@@ e@@ bo
a de@@ ception is something that is a pre@@ ma@@ ture thing , because somebody
so , we &apos;re able to understand each other , i want to show you a very basic , simple , simple magic trick . .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that has at least since the 195@@ 0s in every magic book for children . .
i &apos;ve learned it from cu@@ b sc@@ out pon@@ der &apos;s path in the 197@@
i &apos;m going to ex@@ ec@@ ute him and then explain it . .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i &apos;m expla@@ ining
so , see what happens . .
the kni@@ fe that you can study ; my hand , you can study . . .
i &apos;m just going to hold the kni@@ fe just like that . . .
i &apos;ll leave back my sle@@ ev@@ ine .
and to make sure there &apos;s nothing in my mind that i &apos;m going to be away from it , i will just put my wr@@ ist right
and so you can see that no time &apos;s moving anything , but as i push the clo@@ s@@ h there , there &apos;s nothing in my sle@@ ev@@ es , or coming out
and the goal is that simple . .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if all goes well , the kni@@ fe will em@@ ph@@ asi@@ ze through my bare physical magne@@ tis@@
it &apos;s actually so lo@@ cked in its place that i can sha@@ ke it without fall@@ ing the kni@@ fe . off . .
nothing can go in my sle@@ ev@@ es or come , no tri@@ ck@@ et@@ n . and you can study anything .
da@@ -@@ up !
now , this is a trick that i often teach small kids to do that are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about de@@ ception if you &apos;re looking clo@@ sely , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick . .
now , many of you know here in the hall that this
it works like this .
i think the kni@@ fe in my hand .
i &apos;m saying i &apos;m wra@@ pping my wr@@ ist to make sure nothing in my mind disappe@@ ars or come out , and that &apos;s a lie . .
the reason i atta@@ ch my wr@@ ist is that there is the real secret of illusion . .
and the moment i throw my hand away from them , so you see them from the back , it moves on this finger , that finger finger , just from there , where it was so pro@@ mot@@ ed . . .
great trick ?
there &apos;s somebody sitting in the back of a day .
so , it &apos;s here . exactly . . .
and when i turn around , the fing@@ ers change its
and now you could talk about why that is a de@@ ception , there are only three fing@@ ings below here , because there &apos;s the mind and the way that he process@@ es information , it doesn &apos;t count itself one-@@ on-@@ one , one , two , three , but it
but that &apos;s not really what this is about , and then i open my hand . . .
of course , there are , but not by the magne@@ tis@@ m of my body , it &apos;s going to be by a trick , by my
and when i close my hand , the thing is that i &apos;m looking back on , that &apos;s going to cross by this movement that the fing@@ ers re@@
i &apos;m going to take that hand off . here &apos;s the kni@@ fe
you can run this trick and your neighb@@ ors . thank you . . .
now , what does this have to do with the plac@@ e@@ bo effect ?
one year ago or so , i read a study that really ble@@ w my mind . .
i &apos;m not a doctor , or a resear@@ cher , and that was an amazing thing to me . thing .
so what &apos;s happened is , if you offer a plac@@ e@@ bo in a white p@@ ill , the shape of an as@@ pir@@ ine table , that &apos;s just a round of white p@@ ill that has a measu@@ re@@ ment effect . . .
but if you can change the shape that you &apos;re doing , like , change the plac@@ e@@ bo , like a smaller p@@ ill , and that blue color be@@ ating and that &apos;s a letter of it , it &apos;s actually meas@@ ur@@ able
and that , although none of those pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical -- it &apos;s just su@@ cking up . p@@ ills
but a white p@@ ill isn &apos;t much like a blue p@@ ill . .
what ? it really made me push up .
but it turns out that it &apos;s not all that . . .
when you take cap@@ to@@ cap@@ es , you &apos;re the more active as tab@@ lets in every form
a color@@ ed cap@@ su@@ le that &apos;s on one end and on the other red is better than a white cap@@ su@@ le . .
and the do@@ sage is playing a role .
a p@@ ill twice a day is not three p@@ ills -- i can &apos;t remember the ex@@ act statisti@@ cal statisti@@ cal statistics , so i
but the key thing is ...
... and the do@@ ses are also playing role . .
and the shape is a role . . .
and if you want to have the ulti@@ mate plac@@ e@@ bo effect , you have to grab the need@@ le
right ? a sy@@ r@@ inge with an effective -- a few milli@@ li@@ sts of an effective sub@@ stance that you inje@@ ct a patient . . .
and that creates a very strong picture in mind . that &apos;s a lot stron@@ ger than a white p@@ ill . .
this ch@@ art is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time , if we have a proje@@ ctor . .
in fact , the white p@@ ill doesn &apos;t really look as good as the blue p@@ ill , which doesn &apos;t really work as well as the cap@@ su@@ le that doesn &apos;t really
and none of it has really got something really pharma@@ ce@@ ous its own . it &apos;s just our belief in that it is a stron@@ ger impact . in our mind
i wanted to know if i could use this idea of a magic trick . . .
i &apos;m going to take some of the things that &apos;s obviously a de@@ ception , and
we know that we have to attack the need@@ le when it &apos;s supposed to be a thing .
this is a 18 in@@ ch long whe@@ el . she &apos;s very , very , very , very e@@ ye@@ -@@ long . and i &apos;m going to start a little bit of ster@@
this is really my fl@@ es@@ h . it &apos;s not any gl@@ ori@@ ous fl@@ our@@ ishing of fl@@ our@@ ishing
this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood . .
so i &apos;m going to stick this need@@ le into my skin and run through it until it st@@ ops on
if you &apos;re mad , if you fall slightly in o@@ xi@@ es -- i &apos;ve taught a few friends last night in the hotel room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and i &apos;ve gotten a woman almost to
so i pro@@ pose that if you &apos;re very b@@ ent , then you &apos;ll go away for the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i &apos;m going to make the first hot part
you can see it in a second , but you can also see , if you like .
so , it goes , right here , where my meat starts at the bottom of my arm , i will just make a small sing@@ ing sing@@ ing . . .
am i really sorry . does it be that crazy ? ? that
and just a little bit of my skin , and on the other side , again , again . .
now we &apos;re in the same picture that we &apos;ve got to the kni@@ str@@ et@@ ri@@ c .
about . .
but now you don &apos;t count my fing@@ ers , right ? ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well .
i know what people think when they see that .
they say , &quot; okay , it &apos;s certainly not so stupid , and it &apos;s just to be able to hold the skin for us a few minutes .
well what , does i this &apos;ll look show like you ?
. pretty good . . . .
yeah , i know .
and people say , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t really seen this . &quot; . &quot; .
the people in the side are now coming in . .
let me show you from the middle of it .
it &apos;s really my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
that &apos;s my fl@@ es@@ h , and i can sp@@ in it . .
sorry . i &apos;m sorry if you &apos;re going to look , don &apos;t look like that . look , don
the people back or the ones who go this video later will say , &quot; well , it looks right in terms of this , but if it were real , it would be , you know , this is a hole , and there , if it was really real , it would flo@@ at . &quot; , there it would be
okay , let me put some blood out for you .
yes , here it is .
i would normally take out the need@@ le . .
i would like to have my arm cle@@ an@@ ing and show you that there are no les@@ u@@ es
but i think in this context here , and with the purpose of making a real de@@ ception , i &apos;m going to just let the need@@ le just in it , and go off the stage and
we &apos;re going to disc@@ uss a few more time in the next few
i hope you &apos;ll be happy to look at . thank you . .
everyone talks about happiness today . happiness
i &apos;ve let a few people have been published by the number of books , which are published by happiness in the past five years , and they spent about 40 up , and there &apos;s been
there &apos;s a massive wave of interest in the interest of the researchers under
there &apos;s a lot of happiness co@@ ach@@ ing .
everybody would love to make people happ@@ ier .
but despite all of these ti@@ de of work , there are multiple cognitive ones that somehow make it impossible impossible to think of happiness . happiness . .
and my talk today will be main@@ ly bene@@ ficial by these cognitive los@@
it &apos;s true to la@@ yers of your own fortun@@ es , and it &apos;s for scientists to think about happiness , because it turns out we &apos;re just so conf@@ used like everybody else . . . as
the first of these fall is a resi@@ va@@ tive , complexity effort . . .
it turns out that the word happiness is simply not a useful word , because we &apos;re appl@@ ying too many different things . . .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we can limit@@ e it , but it &apos;s a whole and large , which we need to be giving up , and we &apos;re going to have to take advantage of the complicated view of what comfort is .
the second thre@@ ats is a dis@@ order of experience and memory : basically they &apos;re between happy being in their life and happy with their lives or happy with their lives . in their lives
and these are two very different concep@@ ts , and they are both pl@@ um@@ ped together in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the focus illusion -- and that &apos;s the un@@ happy fact that we can &apos;t think about a situation of being well-@@ being , without dis@@ pos@@ ing its meaning . dis@@ gu@@ sting
i there mean &apos;s , simply this no is way a to
real get cognitive it comp@@ right ass right . .
now , i &apos;d like to start with one example of somebody who had a fra@@ ction and questi@@ on@@ y-@@ s@@ ession after a piece of my lec@@ tures that told a story . &#91; un@@ clear &#93; &#93; he said he &apos;d had a sym@@ ph@@ ony , and it was absolutely great music , and at the end of the recor@@ ding there , there was a terrible piece of noise . at the end of
and then he ad@@ ded down , really quite emotional , and it ru@@ ins the whole experience .
but it didn &apos;t have it
what ru@@ ins the memor@@ ies of the experience of the experience .
he had the experience . .
he had 20 minutes of total music . . .
they did not count because it was with a memory ; the memory was ru@@ ined , and the memory was all he had kept . . memory .
what really tells us that we might think about ourselves and think about other people in the sense of two ways of self . .
there &apos;s a living self that is living in the present and knows the present , is able to experience the past again , but basically has the present . the present .
it &apos;s the living self that the doctor is leading to -- you know , when the doctor asks , &quot; does it hurt now , if i put it on here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a remin@@ der self , and the reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self is that the thing that you coun@@ ted , and it &apos;s the story of our lives right away , and it &apos;s the one that is talking about by the doctor by saying , &quot; how did you feel in the last time ? &quot;
or , &quot; what was your journey to al@@ b@@ ania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different un@@ its , the living self , and the reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self , and the two of them shift is part of the in@@ her@@ ent of happiness . happiness .
now , reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing itself is a story@@ t@@ eller . .
and it really starts with a fundamental reaction to our memor@@ ies -- it immediately starts .
we not only tell stories when we &apos;re going to do it to tell stories
our memory tells us , that is to tell us what we &apos;re feeling to be inter@@ sta@@ ined from our experience
and let &apos;s start with one example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are actual patients who are enter@@ ing a pain@@ ful proce@@ d@@ ure
i will not go into the details . it &apos;s no longer pain@@ ful today , but it was pain@@ ful as this study was condu@@ cted in the 199@@ 0s .
they were asked , all 60 seconds on their pain . .
and here are two patients . these are their recor@@ ds .
and you &apos;re asked , &quot; who of them did more than any suff@@ er
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b has a much more suff@@ ered . his gut refle@@ ction was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient had patient b , and more . . .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much did these patients feel that they were suffering ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient a is a much worse remin@@ der of the gut refle@@ ction than a patient b.
the stories of gut refle@@ ctions were different , and because it &apos;s a very critical part of the story , as it ends .
and none of these stories are very , very sophisticated or great -- but one of them is that clear . .
but one of them is some@@ less than the other . .
and those who was worse was where the pain was on the end of its zen@@ ith , which is a very bad story . .
how do we know ? ?
because we have asked these people about their gut refle@@ ction , and also a lot later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing ? &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
and it was worse for a daughter as b in memory . .
now , this is a direct battle between the living self and the memory self . . .
from the in@@ habit@@ able self , a number was clearly a bad time . . . .
now , what you could do with patient a patient , and we &apos;ve been doing clinical trials , and it &apos;s been done , and it works , you could actually ex@@ tend the refle@@ ction of patient a by simply too much to sha@@ ke down the tube without very much at the bottom .
it will do that the patient is suffering , but just a little less than it did . .
and if you do that for a few minutes , you &apos;ve managed to make the life that &apos;s alive , and you &apos;ve managed to make the reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self from patient a much better way because now you have patient a better story about his experience . . . . .
what is a story ? ?
and that &apos;s true of the stories that we have , and it &apos;s also true to the stories we inv@@ ent . . .
what a story is , the world is bre@@ eding , significant moments of black
so , they end up very , very important , and in this case , domin@@ ated the end .
now living itself lives lives in the world . . .
it has moments of life , one by one . .
and you ask , what happens to these moments ? ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever . . .
i mean , most moments of our life -- and i just found that -- you know , psych@@ ological present is given to about three seconds , and what it does , you know , there are about 600 million of them in a month , and in a month there &apos;s about 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 . most of them don &apos;t leave any tra@@ ce . in a month
most of you are completely ignor@@ ed by the reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self .
and yet , somehow , somehow you get the sense that you should count that what happens during that period of life is our lives .
it &apos;s the limited resource that we consu@@ me as we are in the world . .
and as we were consum@@ ing them , it was prob@@ able , but that &apos;s not the story that holds the reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self for us .
so we reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ed the reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self , and that life itself , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between you is the process of time . .
from the in@@ habit@@ able self , if you have a vac@@ ation and the second week just as good as the first , the second vac@@ ation is twice as much as the one that the previous vac@@ ation . . . . .
that &apos;s not how it works at all for reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing itself . .
for the reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self , a second war@@ l@@ friend bar@@ ely gets better than the one that &apos;s done , because there &apos;s no new memor@@ ies add to this
they didn &apos;t change history . .
and in that way , time is actually the critical vari@@ able that is dist@@ ur@@ bing itself from a living self , and time has very low impact on this story . time . . on
now , the reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self makes more than reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing and told
it &apos;s actually the fact that making decisions , because if you have a patient who , say two , we had two different types of thinking , and we decide to decide which one should , then the one who has memory , the less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon , who is choo@@ sed . . is being cho@@ sen . is going to be
the living itself doesn &apos;t have any voice in this choice .
actually , we &apos;re not choo@@ sing between experiences . we choose between memor@@ ies between the
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future as finding experiences .
we think about our future as the for@@ gotten memor@@ ies . .
and you can look at this , you know , as a ty@@ ran@@ ny &apos;s mind , and you can think of it yourself as one that is kind of the living self by experiences that are not needed to be able to do the living self . . . . .
i feel that if we do a vac@@ ation do this very often , that means we make vac@@ ation pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation in the service of reme@@ dies . . . . . . . . .
and it &apos;s a little hard to justi@@ fy , i think .
i mean , how much to@@ we@@ l we do that we &apos;re making
this is one of the explan@@ ations that the domin@@ ance of the reme@@ ma@@ ce itself is . . .
and when i think about it , i think of a vac@@ ation we did a few years ago at ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , which was clearly the best ur@@ r@@ or i had , and i think , quite often , in propor@@ tion to how many times i think of other vac@@ ations .
and i probably have been spending my memor@@ ies of these tri@@ ang@@ y-@@ worth of jour@@ ne@@ ys , i &apos;d say about 25 minutes in the last four
now , if i ever have the opening open to the 600 pictures that i have spent another hour . . .
well , three weeks , and this is at least one and a half hours . , at
it seems to be a dis@@ cre@@ di@@ table .
well , i like to be a little extreme , you know , in how little appe@@ ti@@ te i have on the to@@ pes of the memor@@ ies , but even if you make it more , you know , why do we give birth to the weight of the weight that we give ? that we give ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next ho@@ li@@ day , you know , at the end of the vac@@ ation , you &apos;re all dis@@ gu@@ is@@ ed by your images and you get an am@@ nes@@ i@@ an drug so that you &apos;re not going to
now , would you choose the same vac@@ ation ?
and if you &apos;d choose another vac@@ ation , there &apos;s a conflict between the two types of self , and you have to think about how you choose that conflict , and that &apos;s really not obvious , because if you think of time , you might get a different answer , and if you think of time , you could get a different answer . memor@@ ies , you could get a
so , why we choose the vac@@ ations that we choose is a problem that we &apos;re looking at with a choice between the two ways
now , the two types of self take two of them to take away
there are actually two concep@@ ts of happiness that we can apply to , one per self .
so you can ask : how happy is the life itself ? ?
and then you &apos;d ask : how happy are the eye points in the life of the resi@@ dents themselves ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for e@@ ck@@ points is quite complicated process .
which ones can be measu@@ red ? ? that
and by the way , we &apos;re now capable of getting a pretty good idea from the fortun@@ e of the living self of the rest of time .
when you ask for the reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing of reme@@ dies , it &apos;s a very different thing . .
this is not how happy a person lives . .
it &apos;s about how content , or ad@@ very , is the person when that person thinks about their life .
very different term .
anybody who doesn &apos;t make these terms is the re@@ creation of happiness , and i &apos;m part of a lot of researchers on comfort that have been dis@@ rup@@ ting the happiness of happiness very long on the very same way . . . . . . .
the distin@@ ction between the in@@ her@@ it@@ ance of the background itself and the satis@@ fac@@ tion of self is in recent years now , and now you &apos;re now going to measure the two pieces of actions . . . .
the gall@@ up organization has been asking a global survey , where more than half a million people have been asked to think about what they think about their lives and about their experience , and there were other effort in the direction .
so in the last few years , we &apos;ve started learning about the very two ways of learning about the
and the main lesson that i think is learning is that they &apos;re really different .
you know how to make someone feel with their life , and the teacher really doesn &apos;t really teach a lot of time about how happy he lives and vice ver@@ sa . .
just to give you a sense of the cor@@ relation between the cor@@ relation , the cor@@ relation is about
what this means is , if you were to meet somebody , and you would tell them , oh , his father is a two-@@ meter man , how much would you know about your size
now , you would know about your size , but there &apos;s a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty . .
they have so much un@@ certain@@ ty .
when i tell you that somebody has been involved in eight in a scale of ten , they have a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty about how happy he is with his living selves . .
so the cor@@ relation is low .
we know a little about what the happiness of happiness itself is . happiness .
we know that money is very important , it &apos;s very important .
we know that happiness meant to be satis@@ fied , to be satis@@ fied with people we like time to spend time with people we
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s domin@@ ant . .
so if you want to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze the happiness of the two types of self , you &apos;re going to end up doing very different things
and the impli@@ cation of what i &apos;ve been saying here is that we shouldn &apos;t imagine the re@@ plac@@ ement for being well-@@ being . is
it &apos;s a completely different term .
well , very quickly , another reason we don &apos;t really think about happiness is because we can &apos;t care about the same things , when we actually live on life , and if we actually
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people in california are not going to get the cor@@ rect answer . . . .
if you ask that question , you think that people in california have to be happ@@ ier when they say , say , o@@ hi@@ o .
and what happens is , when you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that &apos;s what makes the difference , say , climate . .
well , it turns out climate is not very important to the living self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the dete@@ ction itself that deci@@ des how happy people are . people are
well and , it because &apos;s the kind blin@@ of k interesting self to is follow responsible what , &apos;s you going can on end with up people with
who some are people coming at to the the end hope of of the getting day happ@@ . ier . a few . people might .
now , you &apos;re not going to get the more familiar self . .
we know this .
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;ll think they &apos;re happ@@ ier because when they &apos;re thinking about it , they &apos;re remin@@ ded of how awful the weather was in o@@ hi@@ o , and they &apos;ll feel they made the right decision . .
it &apos;s very hard to think of well-@@ being , and i hope i &apos;ve taught you an idea of how difficult it is . .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you . a
thank you . .
now , when we ran on a couple of weeks ago , they said , &quot; this was a pretty interesting out@@ put , which came from this gall@@ up . &quot;
is that something that you can let us share because they now have a few minutes left
dan@@ iel ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man : sure .
i think the most interesting thing we &apos;ve found in the gall@@ up po@@ ll is a number we didn &apos;t expect to find . .
we when found we this looked in at terms emotions of like the the happiness income
of . the society . itself . . . as we
and it turns out that under a 6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very large sam@@ ple of americans , about 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 , but it &apos;s a big repres@@ ent@@ ative sam@@ ple under a income of 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 dollars a year . 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 dollars
6@@ 0,000 .
d@@ k : 6@@ 0,000 .
they are 6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , and they are increasingly un@@ happy , and they &apos;re increasingly un@@ happy , more than they &apos;re going
we get an absolutely flat line . . .
i mean , i &apos;ve sel@@ dom seen flat lines . .
what happens is that money is not caus@@ ing an experience of an experience , but that lack of money will certainly be char@@ ged , and we can measure that one very , very , very , very ,
in the spirit of the self , the reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self , you get another story . .
the more money you ear@@ n you more money is you &apos;re less happy .
it &apos;s not for emotions . .
but dan@@ ny , in the entire american effort it &apos;s about life , freedom , pur@@ suit of happiness . .
when people take this fund seriously , i mean , it seems to put everything on its head , everything we think , for example , in terms of tax@@ -@@ free , and
is there any chance that politicians would take a place in general , and based on the fact that it would take on the seri@@ al level based
d@@ k : you know , i believe that recogni@@ tion gives us the role of happiness in politics . in science
the recogni@@ tion is getting closer in the united states , not a question , but in the u.k. , it &apos;s just happening , and in other countries it &apos;s just happening . in
people are actually trying to recognize that they should be in happiness when they think about politics . .
it will take a while , and people will argue whether they want to study an experience of experi@@ en@@ cing happiness , or whether they want to study life re@@ view , so we have to bring this discussion quite soon . .
how do you raise happiness is going very differently from how you think and whether you think about the reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing self , or whether they think about the living self . . .
this is going to affect politics , i think , in the coming years .
in the united states , you &apos;re looking at the experience of the population of people . . happiness
that &apos;s what i think is in the next decade or two in the world or two in the national statistics .
well , it seems to me , this top@@ ic , at least , is to follow the most interesting political debate about the next few years . about the
thank you for the invention of behavi@@ oral economics . .
thank you , dan@@ ny ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man .
i &apos;m jan@@ e mc@@ gon@@ ig@@ al . i &apos;m making computer games .
i &apos;ve been developing online games for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to make it as easy to save the world in reality , as it is to save in online games . . . .
i have a plan for it . i want to convince more people to spend more time with the playing greater and more enjo@@ y@@ able games . . . .
we currently spend three billion hours a week playing online . .
some of you might think , &quot; this is a lot of time for games . &quot; .
maybe too much time when you think about how many problems we per@@ su@@ aded to solve in the real world . world
but in fact , my research at the institute of the future is that just the opposite is true . .
three billion hours a week , they &apos;re not nearly enough to solve the world &apos;s most ur@@ gent problems .
i actually am convinced that , if we want to survive this planet , we need to increase this planet . , we need to increase this
i calcul@@ ated that there &apos;s been 21 billion hours of play a week . time .
now , that seems to be a little bit more inten@@ se , so repe@@ at it so that i can do it , if we can , like fam@@ ine , poverty , climate change , global conflict and o@@ bes@@ ity , i think we need to do the games of playing online for at least 21 hours a week . the next decade . after the next decade . . at the
no , i really mean it seriously . .
why ? this picture is pretty pre@@ cise , why i think that games are so vi@@ tal to the survival of human species in the future . .
this is a photograph@@ er of photograph@@ er to@@ li@@ dan@@ o . . .
he wanted to capture the feelings of play . so he &apos;d put a camera on the players . . . . .
this is one of the classi@@ cs of play .
if you &apos;re not a player , you may get some of the nu@@ an@@ ces in this picture . .
you probably see this sense of ur@@ gen@@ cy , something fear , but also ex@@ ternal concent@@ ration , deep immer@@ sion , into the resol@@ ution of a really difficult problem . .
if you play yourself , you &apos;ll see some nu@@ an@@ ces here coming up and the mouth is a sign of optimis@@ m . the e@@ ye@@ bro@@ ws show surprise . surprise . surprise . surprise . surprise . surprise .
this oh is , a you player know who that says . that ok there . &apos;s prime a . per@@ so
cal we sie@@ got gl@@ some er gam@@ . ers here . . . . . .
one of the epi@@ c vic@@ tory is a result that &apos;s so wide positive that they didn &apos;t even know it was possible at all . .
it was almost beyond the imagination . . .
and when you get to it , they &apos;re sho@@ cked to be in fact , that &apos;s a thing that is the epi@@ c of
this is a little bit short before you &apos;re a ep@@ an vic@@ tory .
and this is what we have to see on millions of faces around the world if we take the barri@@ ers of the next century in attack , the face of those people who are against all do@@ tten on the edge of an ep@@ cal vic@@ tory . . . the face of those people
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re looking at this face of real life , if we &apos;re getting tough problems . bad problems . bad problems
i call it a bad face than &quot; in life &quot; i am a bad face , and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? ok ? ok . .
this is me being bad , as i am , &quot; face &quot; face . &quot;
this is a gra@@ ff@@ iti in my former home in ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y , california , where i studied why we &apos;re better than in life in the real life . . . . .
this is a problem that a lot of players have . .
we think we &apos;re not as good as games in our games . . .
and i don &apos;t just mean less inten@@ tive , even though it &apos;s done . .
we get more in play worl@@ ds . i mean , in the context of the motivation , to do something significant , to be inspired together . . . .
if we &apos;re in a game world , i think many of us think of our best version , at any time , and immediately hel@@ p@@ ful to try to solve the problem as long as it takes to make it happen after the failure . . . . .
and in reality , if we hit on ob@@ stac@@ les , we often feel different . . . . .
we feel over@@ wh@@ el@@ med . we feel we &apos;ve been con@@ stra@@ ined , and we feel thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed , maybe depres@@ sed , fru@@ strated
we never feel like we play games , we just don &apos;t play them . , they just don
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a grad student . . .
why is it impossible to think about it , you could not just get everything ?
how can we trans@@ fer these feelings from the games into reality ? ? how can
so i looked at games like world of war@@ craft , which provi@@ des the ide@@ al environment for community proble@@ mp@@ s . .
and i &apos;ve found a few things that are oc@@ curr@@ is@@ ic , in the online worl@@ ds that i have
so , first , if you enter one of these online games , especially in the world of war@@ craft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters willing to trust you a worl@@ d-@@ domin@@ ated mission , nam@@ ely . . . .
but not just any mission , but a mission that mat@@ ches perfect to its current level at the game , right ? ?
so they do that . .
you never get a job that you cannot solve . .
but always on the ed@@ ges of its own skills , so you have to get yourself to go and get a bri@@ ck . but there &apos;s no un@@ emplo@@ y@@ ment in the world of
you &apos;re not around , and you &apos;re going to make it feel like you &apos;re always very strong . .
and there &apos;s a way of staf@@ f .
and where you go , hundreds of thousands of people working with them to finish their epi@@ on@@ ary mission .
we don &apos;t have that in the real life that we do that , that feeling that you &apos;re standing with a finger@@ box in your finger@@ flies
and there &apos;s also this epi@@ c story , this in@@ spir@@ ing story , of why we are and what we &apos;re dealing with .
then we get a whole positive feedback . .
they &apos;ve heard of levels high and &quot; you &apos;ve heard &quot; + mas@@ ker . &quot; one intelligence .
this const@@ ant feedback is not in real life . . .
when i leave this stage , i didn &apos;t know : i can &apos;t talk + zero and i can &apos;t tell you , 2@@ 20 fal@@ se idea , of
i don &apos;t get in the real life of that feedback
so , the problem of co@@ oper@@ ative online projects like world of war@@ craft is that it &apos;s so satis@@ fying to stand at any time at the edge of an ep@@ an , that we &apos;re pre@@ fer to spend our time in that game of play .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
to this day , all the world of war@@ cra@@ cial players have spent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years to solve the virtual problems of a@@ sto@@ oth . . .
it &apos;s not necessarily a bit bad . .
it may seem evil . . . .
but to think about it , 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 9@@ 3 million years ago began to be right now to go down to our first pri@@ mate ance@@
so the first exciting care . . .
ok , so when we talk about how much time we spend with play , this makes sense to make sense when you think of the scale of human development in the human development , which is extraordinary . . . . . . .
but also , because it turns out that by using all this time we &apos;re using the games , we actually change the way we human beings are . . as humans
we &apos;re developing collabor@@ ative , car@@ di@@ a@@ c beings . . .
that &apos;s the truth . i believe .
if you look at this interesting statisti@@ cian , recently , recently , a car@@ ne@@ gie m@@ ell@@ on university , the average man of today &apos;s powerful play , has 10,000 hours of online play by the 21@@ st of the day to the 21@@ st of the year . a year
so 10,000 hours is an interesting number of interesting numbers , two reasons
first of all , for children in the united states , there are 10@@ 0@@ 80 hours that are the accu@@ rate total of all the ex@@ changing total of all the time -- if you &apos;re never l@@ ac@@ king . by
so here we have a complete par@@ alle@@ l way of learning about that young people are learning about what it means to be a good player , like everything else you learn in school . . . .
and maybe some of you have a new book of mal@@ col@@ m gla@@ d@@ well , &quot; flying on , &quot; read
so you know its theory of success , the theory of success of 10,000 hours . a 10,000 -@@
it &apos;s based on the amazing science of cognitive science that if we spend 10,000 hours of the prison in a given degree to the 21@@ st of the year , we &apos;re going to be to be the ma@@ ster@@
we &apos;re going to be so good at doing whatever it is to do , as the most
so what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are ma@@ ster@@ -@@ player . . . .
so the big question is , &quot; what exactly are the player &apos;s greatest good ? &quot; good ?
because if we could find that , we &apos;d never have been wa@@ sted human potential . , we &apos;d never solved that .
so many people have now in the world that at least one hour per day will spend online play . . .
these and are in our the ma@@ next ster@@ decade -@@ , player we players have . another 500 billion million players people who who are
are extraordinary extraordinary in in whatever &quot; it something is . . &quot; . . . . . .
if you haven &apos;t heard it . . .
the game industry is creating the energy that saving energy and working on mobile devices , instead of the broad@@ band internet , so that players around the world , especially in india , to be in brazil , to be able to play online online .
you expect a billion billion players in the next decade . .
so we have 1.@@ 5 billion players . . .
so i started to think about what it is , what these games are made of . . .
here are four things that i found . first of all , inv@@ aling it . sense of
ok , imagine how extreme self-@@ motiv@@ ates do .
ur@@ ling efficiency is the desire to do something , to master a hur@@ rier , with the belief that we have an e@@ ye@@ -@@ fit@@ ted hope on success . belie@@ ving that
players always believe that an ep@@ cal vic@@ tory is possible , and it &apos;s always worth trying to try and , not the same
so the players are not sitting around .
players are po@@ et cham@@ pi@@ on of spi@@ ders in spi@@ ders . . .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that show that we people like more than we played with them , even when they &apos;ve started us . . . .
and the reason for that is because it requires a lot of trust to play with somebody .
we believe that someone &apos;s eng@@ aging with us , that the rules are being held , that we have the same goal , and we &apos;re going to end up with the game . .
so that allows you to play together by bon@@ ds , trust and one . . .
and as a result , we &apos;re going to build more powerful social
happy produ@@ c@@ tivity . fantastic ! ! !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the average word of war@@ p@@ ie players play 22 hours a week , so they kind of do a part of time
and the reason is , when we play , we &apos;re actually happ@@ ier , working harder than if we rela@@ x@@ ed or we do nothing . . . .
we know we &apos;re a human being , opti@@ sely , when we do hard , meaning@@ ful work .
and gam@@ ers are always ready to work hard when they get the right job . . .
and finally , epi@@ matic signifi@@ can@@
gam@@ ers love to become the part of the a@@ ge-@@ up dis@@ coun@@ ter planet . . . . .
here &apos;s a back@@ gro@@ t picture to put that in the right , you know all of the wikipedia , the biggest wi@@ ki of the world .
the second largest wi@@ ki of the world , with almost 8@@ 0,000 tu@@ its , is the world of war@@ craft . .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve put more information on the world of war@@ craft on the internet than any other subject in every other wi@@ ki of any world . .
they create a epi@@ c story . .
they create a epi@@ c source of knowledge about the world of war@@ craft .
ok , so these are four super@@ power@@ s that lead to a single out@@ come : players are super powerful , hop@@ e@@ ful individuals . .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world as individuals . .
and the only problem is they think they can change the virtual worl@@ ds , but not the real ones . .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve . .
ed@@ ward ca@@ gam@@ o@@ va is a science scientist . .
his work is great . he studied why humans spend so much time , energy and money on online worl@@ ds . . .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re going to be wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ing not less than a mass of mass of mass and online world environments . &quot; . &quot; . &quot;
and that &apos;s an econom@@ ist . so he &apos;s logi@@ cal .
and he says ...
not like me -- i develop games , i &apos;m a little bit more an@@ gry .
so he says that this gives sense , because players can get more in online worl@@ ds than in real life . . .
they can make more po@@ tent social ties than in the real life , they get more re@@ vie@@ wing and reward re@@ wards in games than in real life . . . .
so he says , it &apos;s entirely logi@@ cal now , that players are in the virtual world than in the real time . .
i &apos;ll just give you one another , that &apos;s logi@@ cal .
but it &apos;s definitely not an opti@@ mal situation . . .
we need to start turning the real world into a game . .
my inspiration comes back from an event that &apos;s been back 2,@@ 500 years ago .
there &apos;s these ancient cu@@ be cu@@ be , you know , she@@ ep . you know ? ?
so , in front of this fantastic spi@@ ritual controll@@ ers , there were she@@ ep . a little bit
and these were the first kinds of people developed to@@ ys .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the works of gre@@ ek histor@@ ian her@@ e@@ ot@@ us , you may know this story . the story of how and why are we invented . history was invented
according to od@@ o@@ ot@@ us , games became more like the same , more cor@@ ru@@ rate , in the king@@ dom , invented by fam@@ ine .
there was such a fam@@ ine that the king of ly@@ di@@ cs had to be a crazy idea . . . .
people were suffering . people were fighting .
it was an extreme situation . it was a very extreme solution .
so they invented , according to , according to o@@ i@@ ot@@ us , the magic game and the agre@@ ement of a national strategy , and on one day you would be eating . day you would be playing . day you
and they would be di@@ li@@ vi@@ ous as they should be di@@ stor@@ ted into the magic game , because games are so fascinating and we &apos;re happy to surro@@ und us with gra@@ ti@@ fication , happ@@ ier produ@@ c@@ tivity that they would forget nothing to eat
and then the next day , you would play . and the next day you would be eating . . on
and according to od@@ o@@ ot@@ us , she survi@@ ved for 18 years , she was eating this fam@@ ine by dinner and played the next game . . .
and the way i think we &apos;re playing games today . . . .
we &apos;re going to play a games to come out the suff@@ ers
we &apos;re going to play a game to avoid everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , and it &apos;s not satis@@ fying what we need from play . life , and we &apos;re getting
but it doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s exciting . .
according to od@@ o@@ ot@@ us , he was not better at the fam@@ ine , so the king was not doing a last par@@ o@@ form game . .
they divi@@ ded the king@@ dom into two . the
they played a car@@ d@@ g@@ game and the ne@@ west thir@@ d-@@ party to a na@@ tive d@@ ad@@ gets . . .
they left poetry and they went looking for a new home , and they just wanted to go back and forth as a new home , and they just wanted to go back as many people as they could live and were in the after@@ fit . in
it sounds crazy , right ? ?
but ne@@ lat@@ est dna evidence shows that e@@ tr@@ et@@ kers , who later did this , who were later building the ro@@ man em@@ b that reve@@ als the same dna as the old ly@@ di@@
so , scientists recently decided to understand that her@@ e@@ ot@@ us &apos;s weird history was actually true . history .
and ge@@ ologists found evidence of a global re@@ fri@@ pa@@ tion that took almost 20 years , which could explain the fam@@ ine . .
so this kind of crazy story could be heard .
you might have res@@ cu@@ ed your people by playing for 18 years , and then they had to have this in@@ built and then learn so much about one another , that they &apos;ve saved the whole civilization . . . population . .
so we can do that . .
we &apos;ve been playing war@@ craft since 199@@ 4 .
this was the first strategy game in war@@ cra@@ ge series in war@@ cra@@ ge series , 16 years ago . 16 years
they were playing cr@@ yo@@ pers for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing war@@ craft for 16 years .
i would like to argue that we are ready for our own epi@@
so , they sent half their civili@@ ans to se@@ arch@@ ing for a new world , so i take my 21 billion bag@@ -@@ hours a week . . . .
we should be over@@ -@@ income that half of us will spend an hour of playing with play , until we &apos;ve solved the problems of
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve the physical world problems in games ? &quot; and so i &apos;ve been paying my work in the institute of the past several years . that question , i &apos;ve been de@@ di@@ cated to
we have this ban@@ ner in our office in pal@@ o al@@ to , it &apos;s like we should understand the future . . . . . .
we don &apos;t want to try and say the future before .
what we want to do is create the future .
we want to think of the best possible out@@ come , and then we think of people to re@@ move this idea of reality . . .
we see epi@@ c sett@@ ings and give people the ways to reach them . . . . .
i &apos;m very quickly showing you three games that i &apos;ve designed to try and create people ep@@ en@@ si@@ vely in their own future . . . . . . .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is from 2007 . .
it &apos;s an online game where you have to over@@ come an oil cal@@ sion .
the oil sc@@ ar@@ city is invented , but we have enough online content to make it reali@@ stic , and actually live their real life without oil , so if you start to address the game , tell us where they live , and then they have to figure out what &apos;s going on , and then they have to figure out how much oil is affected , how to do it , how to help them be dis@@ connected , whether there are dis@@ orders , and they have to figure out how they design their real life when it &apos;s true , how to help them to be educ@@ ated , be a schools closed , and they have to figure out how to design their real life when it &apos;s true , and we ask them to sign up , to hi@@ de video , or photograph@@ ing .
we did this game with 1,@@ 700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been tou@@ ching them over the last three years . .
and i can tell you it was a transforma@@ tional experience . .
nobody wants to change their lives , because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should . . .
but if you &apos;re in an epi@@ c ad@@ vent@@ ure and you said , &quot; we &apos;re going to go out of oil . &quot;
this is a fascinating ad@@ vent@@ ure to go on . . .
find out how they survive . most of our players have been keeping the game in the game . , we have a living hab@@ its .
so for the next world , we &apos;ve got a bigger , more effective goal than it was just oil sp@@ ills . .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; super@@ ble@@ pe &quot; at the institute of the future
the starting point is to calcu@@ late the compu@@ tation of a super@@ computer that people have only 23 years on the planet .
this super@@ computer is called &quot; global dea@@ ths &quot; sensitive , &quot; of course .
the call to gam@@ ing , to sign up , have almost designed a &quot; jer@@ ry bru@@
they &apos;re known to know jer@@ ry bru@@ ck@@ hei@@ ster@@ a movies , where there &apos;s &quot; dre@@ am team &quot; -- they have astron@@ au@@ ts , scientists , the ex@@ -@@ toll@@ , and only together they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of just five people , we say , you &apos;re in the mu@@ u team , and it &apos;s our job to create energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice . . . . . . . . . . . .
ei@@ gh@@ te@@ ,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
they found 500 incredible solutions that they can read when they &apos;re called &quot; super@@ c@@ art . &quot; . . . . .
and the last game we &apos;re going to do on mar@@ ch third : it &apos;s a game involved with the world bank . . . .
when you close the game , you get from the world bank that you &apos;re going to call &quot; social inter@@ turn , &quot; in 2010 . .
we &apos;re working with universi@@ ties in black africa and invi@@ ting them , social re@@ construction . . . .
we have a com@@ ic thing . we have &quot; level high &quot; for regi@@ onal understanding of the world , and we have , you know , about the world level , and we need
i want to invi@@ te you all to share this game with young people around the world , especially in the developing world that benefit from the developing world , to imagine how to save their own social enter@@ prise , to save the world . . . .
i i &apos;ll want get to to ask the you end a
. little bit . . . .
what do you think happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we don &apos;t have the real world yet . . . . . .
well , i hope you agree that language are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a huge signifi@@ can@@ ce for change . . .
we have all these super@@ power@@ s , happy produ@@ c@@ tivity , the ability to make al@@ ig@@ n@@ ment social networks , dr@@ ing@@ ligh@@ ting optimis@@ m , and desire to ep@@ cal signifi@@ can@@ ce . . .
i really hope that we play together more important to survive on this planet another century . . . .
and i hope you &apos;ll design play with me and play . . . .
and if i look into the next decade , i &apos;m sure at two things that we can make any imag@@ in@@ able future , and that we can play all kinds of games .
so i &apos;m going to say , let &apos;s start the world changing games
thank you .
i &apos;d like to share with you something that &apos;s gone up a couple months ago to an article for itali@@ an magazine . .
i have been willing to take my own in the writing , because my field of dic@@ tion@@ ary is really ready , but i was already done with the work of the tex@@ ts , and i noticed that i &apos;d never been be@@ aten in my life , which is
i read the ent@@ ry . .
&quot; dis@@ ab@@ led , &quot; ad@@ vi@@ cul@@ ous : &quot; dis@@ ab@@ led , hel@@ pl@@ ess , help , destro@@ yed , swa@@ p , swa@@ p , dis@@ g@@ ust , dis@@ g@@ ust , dis@@ g@@ ust , ha@@ z@@ zing , en@@ han@@ ced , ha@@ z@@ zing , ha@@ z@@ zing , im@@ po@@ unded , ha@@ d@@ ged , ha@@ z@@ zing , im@@ po@@ unded , ha@@ ir@@ ed , ha@@ un@@ ted , and he broke out of the ra@@ il@@ way , en@@ han@@ ced , en@@ han@@ ced , en@@ han@@ ced , do@@ od@@ ling . swe@@ e@@ ak@@ ess . , he pulled out the ra@@
ant@@ ony@@ me : healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
i read this list of a friend , and i read about it first , it was so ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , but i was only going to be able to speak , and i could continue to read and to read and i had to stop reading and i &apos;d have to read and i &apos;d have to read and to read and i once have to go and stop
of course , this was a crazy old syn@@ ony@@ gh@@ te@@ ary dic@@ tion@@ ary , and i just thought that the ex@@ pos@@ ure must be pretty old .
but in fact , it was an ex@@ act on early &apos; 8@@ 0s when i was starting to start building my self outside of my family background and form my own self outside of my family field field , also in terms of other kids
and thank god i didn &apos;t use any syn@@ ony@@ mous dic@@ tion@@ ary at the time . .
if i would take this one , seriously if i was born in a world that someone like me would have a positive place , that their lives can only run a positive way of doing , but today i &apos;m going to have the opportunity and ad@@ vent@@ ure that i &apos;ve experienced . . for the
so i immediately started calling the online out@@ put from 2009 , and i expected that i &apos;d find a speak@@ er . .
here &apos;s the up@@ date in this ent@@ ren@@ se . .
it &apos;s not much better . .
especially the last two words are sc@@ ared of rand@@ om@@ ony@@ ms , &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot; . . . . .
but it &apos;s not just the words . .
it &apos;s about what we think about people who we think about these words .
it &apos;s the values that are in these words , and how we build these values .
our language affec@@ ts us and how we see the world and the people around us . .
many ancient societies , including the gre@@ e@@ ks and the ro@@ man , really believed that the ex@@ act of a flight has a huge force because what you say is a great force , you can also mani@@ fest , you know ,
so , what do we actually want to do -- a dis@@ ab@@ led people or a powerful people ? a dis@@ ab@@ led people ?
even a person now is to call up four ad@@ oles@@ cents as a child could be enough , to restri@@ ct them and run them into the ideas . .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open you do@@ ors ? ?
a human being opened for me , my pe@@ di@@ atri@@ cian was at a@@ .@@ i@@ . du@@ po@@ nt institute in wil@@ m@@ ington , del@@ ents . in
it &apos;s called dr. pi@@ z@@ zu@@ ll@@ o , dr. pi@@ z@@ zu@@ t@@ .@@ he , whose name , as you can imagine , most americans couldn &apos;t predict cor@@ rec@@ tly , so he became always called dr. p@@ .
and dr. p@@ . f@@ ought very b@@ low , and was just created for the work with kids . . .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- except my physi@@ gue therapy . . in my physi@@
i had to repe@@ at a common one often , and i had to repe@@ at those di@@ ets , el@@ a@@ stic b@@ ases -- different colors -- you know , to build my body muscle , and i hat@@ ed these b@@ ars of more hat@@ e@@ y than anything else . i hat@@ ed them . i &apos;ve hat@@ ed them . . i &apos;ve got
and imagine if i did a five-@@ year-old child with dr. p@@ . i &apos;ve even negoti@@ ated , and so try to stop these practic@@ es , natural l@@ inger without succe@@ eding . . . .
and he was one day , he was watching me on one of my practic@@ es -- these practic@@ es were just hard@@ wired and gra@@ den@@ less -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , ai@@ mee , you are such a powerful , powerful girl , you &apos;ll one day , one of those b@@ ars . .
and if you &apos;re done , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot; . &quot; .
and of course , that was a simple trick from dr. p@@ . so i make the exercise that i didn &apos;t want to do with the pro@@ vision that five year-old girls in the hospital are going to be to the second floor , but i &apos;ve actually made that to see my daily practice hor@@ ror with new eyes , and that &apos;s what it really made . , very promis@@ ing experience .
and i &apos;m thinking now , how much his vision of me as a star@@ t@@ ling and powerful young girl has been formed my own self , and so i could imagine myself as one of nature &apos;s star@@ t@@ ling , powerful and at@@ le@@ th@@ ic humans .
this is just one example of many of the ways in power posi@@ tions that are the imagination of a child .
but as the previous examples from syn@@ ony@@ mous dic@@ tion@@ aries , it gives us no space to imagine what we all wish to be , to en@@ able it to en@@ able everyone to see themselves as a powerful person . .
our language is to the social changes that have been resol@@ ved in many cases by a technical change . . .
vie@@ wing from medical stand@@ point , of course , you can say that my legs , the las@@ er surgery for visu@@ all@@ y-@@ making , k@@ i@@ el@@ d , ti@@ tan and artificial hi@@ p shows for aging body bodies that allow people to actually use all of their possibilities and share about the limit@@ s that they &apos;ve given them in their natural dest@@ in@@ y , to not even talk about social net@@ working , human net@@ working tools en@@ able their own identity , to help themselves define their own way , and engage with groups that are considered
so , maybe it &apos;s a very different kind of technological change that ever has been there , that there &apos;s always been a different truth , which is that every human being has a little special and very powerful , and that the human ability
the human ability ada@@ pt -- this is an interesting story , because people kept asking me the way i deal with wi@@ g@@ le@@ ds and i &apos;m going to stand with you , this phr@@ ase has never mis@@ sed for me , and i &apos;ve always felt like that , this phr@@ ase has never mis@@ sed for me , and i think , in my life , i &apos;m hon@@ est@@ ly
this sentence from the process of wi@@ el@@ ess@@ ness is that it &apos;s from the idea that success or happiness depen@@ ds on a challenge to master a challenge without being associated with the associated experience . as if my life had been so successful , i could give you a pro@@ s@@ thetic amount of life , or whatever people are having me with my dis@@ ability . as it was so success@@ fully lost to people with my dis@@ ability . as it was so success@@ fully lost with me to
but the truth is we &apos;re changing . of course we &apos;re co@@ ined by the challenge , whether they &apos;re physical , emotion@@ ally or in fact . .
and i would like to say that &apos;s a good thing . .
wi@@ el@@ at@@ ties are not ob@@ stac@@ le that we need to re@@ con@@ ci@@ le to get our lives better . .
wi@@ el@@ ds are simply our own lives
and i tend to see quot@@ ations as my sha@@ dow .
sometimes i notice that he &apos;s very up@@ setting , sometimes it &apos;s hard to see , but it &apos;s all in
and i mean , by the time that i &apos;m not allowed to make the impact , the sever@@ e fight of a man &apos;s
there &apos;s ho@@ li@@ ment@@ ali@@ ties in life , and there &apos;s challenges and each person &apos;s being different , and any person is different to do it , but the question isn &apos;t whether we &apos;re acting with wi@@ g@@ g@@ ali@@ ties or not , but how
so it &apos;s not just for us to be responsible for people that we love to keep to keep it comfortable , but they &apos;re also doing good for
and we don &apos;t have to have a little kid when we feel like they can &apos;t ada@@ pt to . . .
you can clearly divi@@ de two things : to one medical fact , am@@ pu@@ te@@ en and the other con@@ sen@@ su@@ s about whether i &apos;m dis@@ ab@@ led or not . . . .
and to be honest , the only real and susta@@ ined dis@@ ability i had to sit upon is because the world thinks she can describe me with those defini@@ tions . , she can
in our des@@ ires , people who care about the heart of the arts , and they &apos;re about to share the p@@ ill@@ ar , hard truth about their medical proje@@ ction , or even a proje@@ ction for quality of life that they expected , we have to pay attention to that somebody is actually dis@@ ab@@ led . . . .
maybe that &apos;s a real concept of what it looks about in a broken , and just paying attention to what &apos;s in a broken , and how we fix that , for each person , a greater dis@@
if we don &apos;t treat a human , and we don &apos;t have all the forces and the opportunities and the opportunities , we can actually make it to the natural sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce that they might
we &apos;re trying to de@@ gra@@ de a human being for our society
so we have to look out the pat@@ ology and focus on all the fields in human ways .
but most importantly , it &apos;s that between perception of our in@@ ad@@ ver@@ t@@ ari@@ al , and our great inv@@ ent@@ or , we
we should not dis@@ miss the challenges , or den@@ ity , we should not try to avoid them , or to avoid them , or to be able to get them under the car@@ pet , but it &apos;s about finding opportunities in the opportunities .
i think maybe it &apos;s more about asking to con@@ front that we don &apos;t necessarily need to over@@ come them , but that we &apos;re open to the hu@@ g , to wra@@ p it to the co@@ w , and maybe even dance with that . too . . .
and maybe we can see it , vi@@ li@@ ties as a natural , dy@@ an@@ di@@ ous and useful and feeling that way , we cannot yet ad@@ vo@@ cate that
this year we cele@@ br@@ ated the 200 birth@@ s@@ ent@@ an@@ s@@ ary of charles darwin , and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin , in my view , has be@@ gun to something very tru@@ sti@@
i would put it in such a way : not survi@@ ving the most powerful of its kind survi@@ vement , and not the most intelligent of his kind , but the one who can in@@ centi@@ vi@@ ze changes in the
there are some creativity that makes creativity . .
not only of darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability to survive and fl@@ our@@ ish , is determin@@ ed by the struggle of human spirit , is determin@@ ed by confli@@ cts to turn through
so , again , change and addi@@ tional is the greatest skills of the people .
and we know , we know what we &apos;re cutting out of , and we really can test out .
that &apos;s what &apos;s possibly the point of wi@@ g@@ ging , a perception of the iphone , a sense of our own
we can en@@ rich ourselves as much . .
we can create a new meaning about wi@@ el@@ ous times that we &apos;re going to
maybe we can see out@@ do@@ ors than change
wi@@ el@@ sen are change that we haven &apos;t yet yet been adap@@ ted to .
i think the biggest damage we &apos;ve ad@@ ded to believe is to believe that we should be normal .
let &apos;s tell you , who &apos;s
there is no normal thing .
there &apos;s the usual thing . the typical one , but not the normal , and would you really know that poor , gra@@ y person , if you really had
i think it &apos;s not .
it would be great if we could put that paradig@@ m in the normal context of the kind of possibilities or the strength to even make it even more dangerous , to exchange out the forces of very many people , and invi@@ te them to bring their special and valuable ability into the society . . .
so what you found is that , you know , anthro@@ pi@@ ons of our society have been asking for a staf@@ f : being useful and contribu@@ ting a contribu@@ tion .
there is evidence that already ne@@ anderth@@ als had , 6@@ 0,000 years ago , older people and people with sever@@ e physical in@@ j@@ ury , and that may be because the life experience in the over@@ -@@ survival of these people has been more valuable . .
they don &apos;t have these people as broken and in@@ effective ; they were treated as something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i went to the town where i grew up , in a gro@@ und@@ -@@ market market in the nor@@ the@@ ast of pen@@ n@@ syl@@ v@@ ania , and i was standing there in a mag@@ nifi@@ cent to@@ ma@@ to .
it was summer , and i was shor@@ ting . .
and i hear a guy behind me saying , &quot; well , if that wasn &apos;t ai@@ mee mul@@ lin@@ s . &quot; . &quot;
and i turned around and i &apos;m looking at these el@@ der@@ ly man . i had no clu@@ e who
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember them . &quot; . not to
and he said , &quot; well , you &apos;re not going to remember me
when i first saw it , i brought her out of the gut of her mother . &quot; .
oh , the guy .
and of course , it &apos;s got click . . .
this was dr. ke@@ en@@ e , a man i knew just from narra@@ tive my mother on this day because i , of course , got too late , i &apos;d be too late to my birth@@ day two weeks . too
the doctor for the pr@@ at@@ at@@ al diagno@@ stics of my mother was in a vac@@ ation , and my parents had the man who brought me to the world at all .
and because i was born without wa@@ king legs and my feet had measu@@ red to them , and i just had a few to@@ es on this one , and i had a few to@@ es on the other foot , and it was the over@@ man , that stran@@ gers had to get the bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to say to your parents that you would never walk , and never become the way that other kids would never live , and they &apos;ve never been a ste@@ ad@@ y way of being , and since then they &apos;ve just been ra@@ mp@@ ed me . &quot; &quot; since then ,
i found that it took time cu@@ ps of time in my entire childhood , whether i &apos;d won a boo@@ k@@ store in the second class , whether i &apos;d won a boo@@ k@@ post in the second class in the second class , whether i was going around the cr@@ us@@ ade , or one of my spor@@ ts se@@ ats , in the second grade , whether i had been around to hal@@ lo@@ ween in the world &apos;s fin@@ ance , and he used that s@@ ni@@ bit@@ ing dis@@ section to teach his students to teach
and he called this part of his short class that &apos;s the potential for the human will@@ ing@@ ness .
you can &apos;t em@@ ph@@ asi@@ ze enough , the key thing that this issue can be for the quality of a human being .
and dr. ke@@ an kept saying , he said , &quot; i learned that kids , if they don &apos;t know anything else , and even if they get a little bit of support , if you keep kids to keep themselves , then children can achieve a lot . &quot;
see , dr. ke@@ an changed his thinking . .
he understood that medical diagno@@ sis , and how somebody rel@@ ate to it , are two different things .
and i also changed my thinking over time when i asked me about 15 years ago , if i had been di@@ vor@@ ced by the age 15 , if i had been di@@ vor@@ ted for legs for legs and bone , i would have been a second . . . .
i was usually meant to be normal . . . .
if you ask me today , i &apos;m not that sure . .
and this is what happened because i &apos;ve had something with my legs and not in spi@@ te of that experience . . .
and maybe this change could happen because i was fac@@ ed with so many people who have opened me do@@ ors , instead of people who wanted to have me , or have an imagination , i want to give
you see , it really takes a really only human being to show you how to mani@@ fest your power@@ s , and they &apos;re on the
if you can en@@ list someone to activ@@ ate their own inner strength -- the human mind is so dis@@ in@@ ci@@ p@@ ated -- if you can do that for somebody in a critical moment , they &apos;re a very good teacher . for these people .
they teach them to open up their do@@ ors . .
the real meaning of the word &quot; out@@ come &quot; in the word &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; is &quot; in the word &quot; &quot;
it means that in one , you know , that in one , the potential is ti@@
so again , what potential do we want to call ? ?
in the &apos; 6@@ 0s , a study study was condu@@ cted in the u.k. , and then the next college study was conver@@ ted into all 12 schools
they call this &quot; stre@@ aming here &quot; in the united states , we call this &quot; tracking . &quot;
students are cut up notes . . . . . .
and the student is being che@@ cked to be che@@ cked to the more teachers , get the better teachers and so on
you &apos;ve got a couple of time in time with a three-@@ month period of time , &quot; the note , &quot; very good , and they told them they &apos;re mad that they were very clever , and after three months they really wrote one . . after three months they
and of course , it brea@@ ks the heart that the other way in which the people told the people who told you were just enough . . . . . .
and then it was also after three months . . . .
but only those who were still in school -- except the students who had s@@ nat@@ ched school .
the cru@@ cial thing about this study was that the teachers were not con@@ stra@@ ined .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed . .
they were just told that the students are one-@@ to-@@ one students and the students that are enough enough , and the same is the same student and they &apos;ve taught them something to do . .
the but only if real we dis@@ can ability do is it a , broken the mind human a spirit mind continu@@ that es has to been hope broken to has hope no to more be hope a . very he , fin@@ very ds honest no and more emotional beautiful thing , , and and he
then doesn we &apos;t put count our our power natural really capacity positive , . child@@ curious and curi@@ fan@@ osity t@@ , asy and , our we in@@ really na@@ make te our capacity forces to positive imagination . . . . . . . . .
when a mind has this brain , we can create a new reality and new understanding . . . .
i want to end with a po@@ em that was con@@ fin@@ ed by an per@@ si@@ an po@@ et called ha@@ fi@@ z in 14@@ th century , and my friend jac@@ ques de@@ bo@@ is has told me , and the po@@ em is called &quot; the god who only knows four words . &quot; &quot; every child knows god , not the god of the name , not the god of the left , but the god who only knows about four words and all repe@@ at over , he says , &quot; come dance with me
come dance with me . thank you . . . . . .
how would you want to be better than you &apos;re currently ?
so if i had to think that , through a few changes in their genes , they could have a better memory -- pre@@ cise , more speed . . .
or do they want to be a fit@@ ter , more powerful , more power . .
would how you about like living to for become good more health attra@@ ?
ctive and health confi@@ ? dent ? ? ? it
or maybe they &apos;re one of those who &apos;ve always been hon@@ or@@ ed for more creativity .
which would you like the least ? ?
which would you like to have if you could have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably , about many of the creative people there . .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would have to decide for a good
a couple more . .
how about fit@@ ness ?
a few less .
what about lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty ?
ah if , you the could majority have . one the of l@@ these um@@ , p it
i would like be to a see very , different as world a . physi@@ cian .
is that all accoun@@ ts ? ?
or is it possible ? ? .
evolution has been a continu@@ ing top@@ ic on the ted conference , but today i want to give you the point of a drug of medicine . . .
the great gene@@ tics in the 20th century , t@@ .@@ bt do@@ b@@ b@@ han@@ sky , who was a communic@@ ant in the russi@@ an or@@ tho@@ do@@ x church , once wrote a paper that was called &quot; nothing in biology . &quot; &quot; nothing in biology . &quot; &quot; in the universe . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of these who accept the pro@@ of of biological evolution , this would be a very good time , to turn off your hearing device -- and i &apos;ll give you per@@ mission -- and maybe you can take a look at ca@@ thr@@ yn ten@@ tz &apos;s book , which is about being wrong , because nothing in the other day will make some sense for you . . . . that
but if you accept biological evolution , you think , is it just about the past , or is it about the future ? the
is it true for others or is it also us ? ?
this is another view of the tree of life .
in this picture , i &apos;ve got a bush as a center of the des@@ pair in all direc@@ tions , because if you look at the ed@@ ges of the tree of life , all the exi@@ sting speci@@ ally in evolutionary terms , they have been in evolutionary terms : they survi@@ ved ; it &apos;s meant to demon@@ strate its environment , to demon@@ strate star@@ t@@ ling
the human part of the bu@@ g , far at the end , is the pu@@ ff of the pu@@ n . , of course , is what
we in &apos;re this two period by of a time common , ance@@ maybe st@@ there or were of 20 ancient or chimpanze@@
25 es different , speci@@ about zations a from new hom@@ chimpanze@@ ini@@ e ds about . six or . eight
some of them have come and left
we &apos;ve been here for about 13@@ 0,000 years ago .
it seems that we &apos;re pretty dist@@ ur@@ bed by the other parts of life , but actually , most of the building , the basic mechanis@@ ms of our cells are pretty much the same . ,
so , you realize that we can use them to be able to make the mechanis@@ ms of a common bacteri@@ um to produce the code of the human insu@@ l@@ ic , which is used to
this is not like human@@ insu@@ lin ; this is the same protein that &apos;s chemi@@ cally dis@@ connected from what comes from the pan@@ cre@@ as . . . .
and as we talk about bacteria , what &apos;s aware of you that every one of us in our gut is more bacteri@@ ous than the cells are leading in the
maybe 10 times as many .
i mean , think , if ant@@ oni@@ o dama@@ si@@ o asks you to think of her self-@@ portra@@ it , think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful ho@@ st environment for these bacteria . .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s we@@ t , it &apos;s very comfortable . .
and you &apos;ll all be nutri@@ ents that you could just want to offer yourself without eff@@ or@@ ting . hard to
it &apos;s a really easy way to get bacteria , with occasi@@ onal inter@@ rup@@ tions of un@@ inten@@ ded , je@@ od@@ a forced to get a hand@@ le
but else , they &apos;re a mag@@ nifi@@ cent environment for these bacteria , just like they &apos;re for their lives .
they help in the dis@@ charge of food , and they protect certain diseases . . . .
but what will happen in the future ?
are we in a kind of evolutionary equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um in a form of
or are we supposed to be different -- something that perhaps is adap@@ ted to the environment ? ? that perhaps is
now , let &apos;s take a step back over the big bang before 14 years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first indi@@ cation of creatures , maybe three or four billion years ago -- and then the human species , which will then transform in the last 13@@ 0,000 years . , and then the human species , which will last in the last 30 thir@@ ds of years . as
in this vast un@@ finished sym@@ ph@@ ony of the universe , life on earth just measu@@ red in a short way ; the animal king@@ dom , like a single pe@@ t@@ board , and the human life , a little
we were . .
this now also , represents when the i behavior was of a this &quot; talk ne@@ , min@@ which ing is on why
college i , hope i it had &apos;s my a first good bi@@ pleasure ologi@@ to c enjoy cour@@ . ses .
i was fascin@@ ated by the elegan@@ t and beauty of biology .
i fell into the power of evolution , and i was having something very fundamental : most of the existence of life in the individual organisms , each cell , and all of the genetic information of the cell is going to be more exten@@ ded to both to@@ ds . . . cells .
but at the time , the multi-@@ pl@@ ot@@ ular organisms began to change things .
sexual re@@ production goes into the picture .
and most importantly , with the introdu@@ ction of sexual re@@ production , on the other hand , the rest of the body will be de@@ gra@@ ded .
in fact , you could say that the inevi@@ table of your body in evolution at the same time is the sexual re@@ production of the body in the same moment .
now i have to conf@@ ess , when i was a college student , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed like a pretty comfortable at that point , but with every year , it &apos;s my increas@@ ed two-@@ stick . at that time , it
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george bur@@ ns who introduced his show in the &apos; 9@@ 0s . in las v@@ eg@@ as . .
and one night , it &apos;s a pi@@ cking from his wall room . .
he op@@ ens the door .
in she front looks of at him him , and a he beautiful says spi@@ , t &quot; sho@@
i w@@ &apos;m girl here . for super@@ . -@@ sex . . &quot; .
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; says , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the sou@@ p . &quot;
i came to see that as a doctor , i was doing a goal that was different than the goal of evolution -- not inevi@@ table , just different . . . .
i &apos;ve tried to keep the body . .
i wanted to keep us healthy .
i wanted to re@@ store the health of a disease
i wanted us to live a long and healthy life .
evolution is everything going on the further part of the genome to the next generation , adap@@ ting and survival generation generation generation .
from an evolutionary point of view , you and i are like bo@@ ats , rock@@ sters , to send the genetic spo@@ ts into the next step of the orbit to get to the sea . .
i think we would all be able to get the mo@@ od out of the woo@@ dy allen to say , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to get any im@@
i don &apos;t want to be a person . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t inevi@@ t@@ ably mean that it &apos;s alive to pre@@
it wasn &apos;t necessarily com@@ promis@@ ed to the biggest , the stron@@ gest or the fa@@ st@@ est , and even the smar@@ test one
evolution pri@@ mand@@ ed the creatures that are best adap@@ ting to their
it &apos;s the only test and success . . .
and on the bottom of the ocean are the bacteria that are ther@@ m@@ op@@ hi@@ l , and by doing so , the bu@@ mp will be used to leg@@ ally , if they were there , it would co@@ ok that they had coo@@ ked fish to follow their hands up . . . .
so , what does that mean when we look back on what &apos;s going on in evolution , and how we think about space in evolution , and , in particular , we might expect to see the next phase , i would say there are a number of ways . .
the first is , we &apos;re not going to be able
we &apos;ve reach@@ ed a kind of equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um .
and the reasons for that were that we were first in medicine , and we have a lot of genes to get the symptom@@ s that would be sel@@ ec@@ ted and re@@ moved from the population . the population .
and second , we as a species of species has been char@@ ged by our environment that we &apos;ve been able to ada@@ pt to us just as much as we &apos;re adap@@ ted to
and by the way , we &apos;re traveling and cir@@ cul@@ ating and mix@@ ing and mix@@ ing so much that they can no longer tell , that isol@@ ation is necessary for the evolution to find stat@@
a second option is that it will be a evolution of the traditional way , of course , un@@ equi@@ pped by the forces of
and the argument here , here was the whe@@ els of evolution slowly , but they are un@@ com@@ promis@@ ed . .
and so far , the isol@@ ation goes when we col@@ oni@@ ze planet , it &apos;s going to be insu@@ lation and the changes in the environment , which could make evolution naturally in natural ways . .
but is there a third option to lock a more intri@@ gu@@ ing , fascinating , and a@@ sc@@ ill@@ a , and
i call it ne@@ o-@@ evolution ; the new development that is not natural , but led by us as an individual , and i decided to do that in the decisions that we make
now , how could this happen ?
how could it be possible that we could do this ?
let &apos;s start by looking at reality that people today today are making decisions about their off@@ spring . . .
they are , in some cultures , to have more men than women . . . .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but is what the individual and the family choose . . .
so if you think that if it wasn &apos;t just possible that your child &apos;s eyes could be able to pick up your child &apos;s , and to re@@ move genetic adap@@ tation , that would cure disease and prevent pre@@ ven@@ tion .
what if they could make the genetic changes to elimin@@ ate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease or reduce cancer risk or stro@@ ke to the risk of a
would you like to do it , these changes in your genes ?
if we look out , these kinds of changes are going to be increasingly possible .
the human genome project started in 199@@ 0 , and it took 13 years .
it cost 2.@@ 7 billion dollars .
the next year , in 2004 , they could do the same for 20 million dollars to get the same thing to do for about four
today it , &apos;s you not can going make to a take sequence a of long the time three to billion be base a pa@@ reality irs , of that the it human will genome be to
1,000 a dollars price of of human about genom@@ $ es 20@@ , ,000 and and it in will the increasingly space be of available about to a everyone week . . . .
a week ago , the national acade@@ my was awar@@ ding engineering for the 3@@ 0-@@ dollar prize prize , the dra@@ at prize prize prize prize prize prize , and the wil@@ dest emp@@ tin@@ es , two scientists who have become independent techniques that have developed the natural process of evolution to encourage evolution to work and to need more and more protein in a more efficient way -- which fran@@ ces ar@@ n@@
a few years ago , the coffee price was the scientist sh@@ in@@ ya y@@ am@@ an@@ ak@@ a for his research in which he took a adult skin of food , a fi@@ bro@@ cr@@ ist , and by the manipu@@ lation of just four genes that the cell indu@@ ced to a plu@@ ri@@ po@@ tent stem cell -- a cell poten@@ tially capable of being able to be random in your body . . a cell
these changes are in place .
the believe same it technology or that not produ@@ , ces it human &apos;s insu@@ an lin experiment@@ in al bacteria study is in that the viruses gang can against make influ@@ that enz@@ , a
not that just &apos;s protection been , built but in can the also cells serve of imm@@ a unity tab@@ against let other plant viruses . . . . . .
can you imagine something good that comes from to@@ ck ? ?
this is all of all reality , and in the future , we will be able to do a lot
so , imagine if there &apos;s only two other
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells &apos; cells ? ?
what if they could change the sper@@ m and the eg@@ wn cells , or the new@@ ly ferti@@ ed eg@@ g , to give their children a better chance of a heal@@ thi@@ er living -- ir@@ on@@ g@@ y-@@ i@@ dio@@ king diabetes , re@@ duced the risk of cancer ? the risk of can@@ cers ?
who &apos;s not going to be heal@@ thi@@ er ?
and then the analy@@ tical techni@@ que , same engine of science that can en@@ able the changes to prevent disease , could also make us to adop@@ t it , to adop@@ t simple at@@ tribu@@ tes , to adop@@ t a hyper@@ -@@ capacity .
why not have the head@@ ness of a single club , especially when you can exp@@ and it with the next generation of wat@@ son@@ -@@ machine ? , when you
why not have fast muscle fi@@ bers that will en@@ able you to run faster and longer ? ?
why no longer ? ?
these are going to be dis@@ rup@@ tive .
and if we &apos;re at a place where we can continue to the next generation , and we can adop@@ t the at@@ tribu@@ te that we want , we become trans@@ formed by old style of evolution to ne@@ o-@@ evolution . evolution
we &apos;re going to have a process that probably requires 100,000 years of that , and we can com@@ press it in a thousand years -- and maybe even to the next 100 years
these are decisions where their grand@@ children are going to be able to get to their grand@@ children . .
do we use these decisions to form a society that is better , the more successful ? friend@@ iness ? more
or will we become sel@@ ec@@ tively different , which we want to have for some of us , and not for others ? ?
are we going to form a society of di@@ el@@ rhe@@ a and uni@@ form , or ro@@ bu@@ ster and more , and more like
these are the kinds of questions we need to face . .
and most of all , we &apos;ll ever be able to develop the wisdom , and ma@@ ture , who we &apos;re going to need to make these decisions ? ? ? that we &apos;re going
in the good way , in the evil , and early as you might think , these decisions are us . .
thank you .
i want you to imagine something , a port@@ able robot that gives you human power , or another one that helps you to stand up and go to the ride . .
in ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y bi@@ on@@ ics , this robot is ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on@@ ated .
they &apos;re not something they put in the morning and ex@@ pos@@ ure you to an em@@ bo@@ und , and increase their speed at the bottom , and that will help you to keep their balance . . . . .
that &apos;s indeed the real mel@@ ting of human and machine . .
but not only that -- that &apos;s what inter@@ ests and conne@@ cts to the universe and other devices out there .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea . .
to just show you what we &apos;re working on , we &apos;re going to start talking about the american soldiers who are on average , about 100 pounds on its back , and it &apos;s the question that they should be contribu@@ ting more .
of course , this leads to some major compli@@ cations -- spin@@ al in@@ j@@ ury , 30 percent of it -- chron@@ ical spin@@ al in@@ j@@ ury .
so we thought we would take this challenge and create an ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on that would help us deal with this problem .
so let me introduce you now to h@@ ul@@ que -- or the human universal you car@@ car@@ r .
soldi@@ er : with the h@@ ul@@ c ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on , i can carry 200 pounds above a variety of different ter@@ rain , for
his flexi@@ ble design allows to get a deep way to ring and to make a very simple mo@@ od .
it feels what i want to go , where i want to go and reach my strength and in@@ do@@ ors . . .
we &apos;re so far here to imagine the industrial partner that this device , this new ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on , this
so it &apos;s true . .
let &apos;s now look at our vie@@ wing cli@@ el@@ ly users , something i &apos;m particularly passionate about . .
there are 6@@ 8 million people who are ma@@ sting around the world . . .
that &apos;s about one percent of population population . .
and that &apos;s indeed a conser@@ va@@ tive esti@@ mate .
so we &apos;re often talking about very young people with back@@ -@@ cor@@ d in@@ j@@ ury in their life -- 20@@ s , &apos; 3@@ 0s , and the whe@@ el@@ chair is the only option . , they were made the way they want . a whe@@ el@@ chair is
but it &apos;s also about aging population , which is multi@@ pli@@ ed . .
and pretty much the only option -- if it &apos;s a brain stream , or anything of compli@@ cations -- is the whe@@ el@@ chair
and so , by the way , for the atmosphere , we &apos;ve had a lot of success in this .
so we thought , we could start to write a whole new chap@@ ter in the field
now , let me introduce you to an ele@@ -@@ based , which is car@@ ried by am@@ anda bo@@ x@@ ar , who has been a spin@@ al cor@@ d in@@ j@@ ury 19 years ago , which has the result that she couldn &apos;t walk for 19 years and
thank you .
as i said , am@@ anda is carrying our ele@@
it has sensor@@ s .
his completely non-@@ invasi@@ ve sensor@@ s in the cru@@ t@@ ches , send back the signals to our on@@ bo@@ ac@@ y computer , atta@@ ched to your back .
here &apos;s a battery pac@@ k@@ aging , the motor engine is on your hi@@ ps , as well as your k@@ ne@@ ater , you move forward in this pretty l@@ ous@@ y and very natural gan@@ g@@ mic . . . .
i was 24 years old , and i was in ty@@ it@@ or , as a mon@@ soon ca@@ ck@@ tree , as a ski@@ ing ride . a
in a fra@@ ction of a second , i lost every sense and every movement underneath my re@@ ck@@ ens
not long after that , a doctor in my hospital room and he said , &quot; you know , you know , you &apos;ll never go again . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago . 19
he &apos;s a fl@@ our@@ ishing every five hop@@ es from my consciousness .
adap@@ tive technologies have been able to learn me to go again , drive sc@@ ou@@ mp , and even drive with my hands . . .
but nothing was invented that would let me go , right now . .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have these plat@@ forms to meet and argue with them . . .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we &apos;ve got the whole potential here to change life , to change future generations -- not just for the military , or am@@ anda , and all the whe@@ el@@ cha@@ y-@@ direc@@ tors , but for
thank you .
in new york in new york , i &apos;m a ce@@ o of developing a non@@ profit organization called ro@@ bin
if i don &apos;t fight poverty , i &apos;m fighting as a fir@@ st-@@ nur@@ se of a fire@@ fire at a volunte@@ er de@@ br@@
now in our city , in the volunte@@ ers of a high-@@ sk@@ ill fire department , they have to be suppor@@ ted very early on the br@@ us@@ h to be able to collabor@@ ate . .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunte@@ er on the br@@ us@@ h , so i was really good at it . well . .
but it was still a wea@@ pon against the other volunte@@ ers who were in charge of the main man and figure out what our work would be . . .
when i was finding the main man , he had just in a very serious conversation with the home@@ ow@@ ner who had sur@@ ely had one of her worst days of her life .
it was in the middle of the night , and she was in the bedro@@ om and bar@@ foot under a screen out in the rain , while her house was on the fl@@ ames . . . . . .
the other volunte@@ ers , who had been coming out of me , is -- let &apos;s call le@@ x lu@@ ther -- did the big man first and was asked to go into the house and save the dog of the
the dog ! i was a l@@ ing@@ -@@ lost . .
there was some law@@ yer or a commercial admini@@ stration , who was now able to tell people that he went into a burning house to get people to be able to get to a burning house , just because it was five seconds faster than
now , i was the next one
the main man &apos;s head@@ ing to me .
he said , &quot; be@@ z@@ os , you need to go into the house . .
you have to go up , you know , go to the fire , and you have to take this woman a few shoes . &quot; .
i swe@@ ar it .
now , not exactly what i hope to think of , but i went out -- the sta@@ irs , the hall@@ way , the hall@@ way , the &quot; the fire@@ fire@@ men , &quot; which was pretty much done with the d@@ ele@@ d@@ le , were already pretty ready to take some shoes . in the
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i was wearing my re@@ es down , where i &apos;d come to my front door , my che@@ ad@@ y and the lo@@ ving dog .
we wor@@ e our dis@@ pos@@ al out to the door , where , not surpris@@ ingly , his signific@@ antly more attention took when i was .
a few weeks later , the fire rus@@ h got a letter to the home@@ ow@@ ner where she would go to res@@ cu@@ e her house and her house .
one of the things that &apos;s happened is that someone had a ma@@ ster@@ ed friend@@ lin@@ ess . a pair of
in my career , ro@@ bin hood and my side prof@@ ession as a volunte@@ er , volunte@@ er fire@@ man i &apos;m wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ing from gener@@ osity and kin@@ dness at the big scale , but also the next love of mind and the mu@@ ce of individuals . . . . .
and you know what i learned ? what
they &apos;re all important .
so if i look around this room and see people who &apos;ve either achie@@ ved a pre@@ cious achie@@ vement or they are on their way on , i want to offer back this way : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in another , until you &apos;ve reach@@ ed your first million .
if you give them something , they give it up now .
you put it in a car@@ ing kitchen , you put a park in the
be a ment@@ or .
not every day will offer us a chance to save a person &apos;s life , but every day we give us an opportunity to change one . .
so they go out ; they save the shoes .
thank you .
br@@ un@@ o gu@@ is@@ san@@ i :
thank you .
i &apos;m just coming back from a community that &apos;s known the secret of the pro@@
a place where women are leading the reci@@ ters , with sex , say , &quot; they &apos;re going to say , where fun is a serious thing .
and no , it &apos;s not an out@@ -@@ man or a san
ladies and gentle@@ men , their rela@@ tions . .
this is the world of the wild bon@@ o@@ o at the base of con@@ go . .
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are together with chimpanze@@ es our next living rela@@ tives . .
that means we have a common ance@@ st@@ or , an evolutionary grandmother , who lived about six million years ago . .
now , ch@@ im@@ ps are known for their ag@@ gressi@@ ve responsibility .
but unfortunately , we have this aspe@@ ct of de@@ dic@@ ating human evolution in the narra@@ tive of human evolution . . .
but bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s show us the other side of the me@@ d@@ al .
as chimpanze@@ es of the ch@@ im@@ ps of great , fear im@@ pac@@ ting , the bon@@ o@@ bo@@ -@@ society is led to em@@ power@@
they really came up with something , because this leads to an ex@@ tent to be an in@@ toler@@ ant society in the killing of violence . .
but unfortunately , bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are the least known as the pri@@ mates . .
they live in the deep of the con@@ gol@@ ese ur@@ wh@@ ds , and they &apos;re just the obser@@ vation of acc@@ essi@@ ble
con@@ go is a parado@@ x@@ ical version -- a country of extraordinary bio@@ diversity and beauty , but also the heart of the dar@@ k@@ ness itself -- the scene of a violent argument that has strug@@ gles and nearly so many lives have been in the same world world war .
it &apos;s not surprising that this destruction is also en@@ danger@@ ed to the survival of
meat and the dec@@ line of the tree per@@ forms to you , not even to be able to fill the kind of a sta@@ dium with the bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s -- and even there we are , frank@@ ly , to be
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a hidden lau@@ ghter that the trees are
who are these related ? ?
we know what &quot; love &quot; mon@@ se &quot; mon@@ key , because they have more frequ@@ ent , bis@@ ex@@ ual sex , with shif@@ ting part@@ ners , and rules so conflict and social issues
i &apos;m not saying that that &apos;s the answer to all the human@@ it@@ arian problems -- because the people lives of bon@@ o@@ o more than the cam@@ a su@@ tra .
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s -- how humans -- love to play their life for their own lives
play is not just about the games .
for us , and it &apos;s fundamental to the engagement of relationships and care of toler@@ ance . . .
and we &apos;re learning that we trust and the rules of the game . . .
but game and resili@@ ence is about creating diversity and diversity , and it &apos;s all about gener@@ ating diversity -- diversity of inter@@ actions , diversity of ways , diversity of
and when you see bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s playing the game , you see the evolutionary orig@@ in of human sal@@ mon , dance and ritu@@
play is the ti@@ t that holds us each . .
now , i don &apos;t know about you , but i want to show you some unique foot@@ age right out of the wild . a little
first of all , a ball game on bon@@ o@@ bo@@ -@@ style -- and i don &apos;t think it &apos;s on
so here we see a young female and mal@@ es in a se@@ arch@@ y game . .
look at what she does . what she
this could be the evolutionary orig@@ in of this , &quot; it &apos;s pac@@ king him in the eg@@ ws . &quot; .
i think it &apos;s more that i think it &apos;s more than it .
yeah !
so , sex games are spre@@ ading both with bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s and in
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the idea of the most powerful , which brings up new elements -- like the ho@@ des -- and as the game both asks both trust and pro@@ mot@@ ing -- as it does , and as
but the game is a form chan@@ ger . .
play is a form of form , and it can take many forms , some of which are quie@@ t , phan@@ tom , curious -- maybe just to discover the amazing rene@@ w@@ y . . .
and i want to show you , this is fu@@ k@@ u , a young female , and she plays pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful with water .
i think , just like you do , sometimes we can do it alone , and we &apos;ve po@@ is@@ oned out the boundar@@ ies of our inner
and it &apos;s this play@@ ful curi@@ osity that we &apos;re doing , and interact , and the un@@ expected lin@@ ked that we form are the actual nutri@@ tion of creativity . . .
this is just a little bit taste on the insi@@ ghts , the bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s , us in our past and the
but they also have a secret for our future , a future that we have to ada@@ pt to increasingly increasing challenges , through greater creativity and po@@ tent co@@ operation .
the secret is that the game is the game of the key to these skills
in other words , play is our adap@@ tation jo@@ ker .
to ada@@ pt to us , success@@ fully , to be successful , we need to play .
but will we make the best of our play drive ? ?
play is not an@@ gry . .
it &apos;s essential .
for bon@@ o@@ o , and humans equ@@ ally multi@@ pl@@ or@@ ed , life doesn &apos;t work on teeth and cla@@ ws
just when it &apos;s bar@@ ely ob@@ ly , play is maybe the most legi@@ ti@@ mate . . .
and so my pri@@ mate co@@ ach@@ es , let &apos;s take this gift of evolution , and play together , as we &apos;re making the creativity and the wonder of the wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two pa@@ irs in the middle of 197@@ 9 , on the same day , and each one is a baby -- okay . . . . .
so two pa@@ irs , each one &apos;s a baby .
now i don &apos;t want you to spend too much time , because if you think about the manufacturing all the time , you won &apos;t listen to me . , you won &apos;t listen to me .
think about that for a moment . .
and in this scen@@ ario , you imagine that in a case that was sper@@ m , in a case , the sper@@ m is a y ch@@ om@@ o@@ sau@@ m that &apos;s hit@@ ting the
and in the other case , it &apos;s the sper@@ m by the x of the x , which is the x chromo@@ some of the eg@@
they &apos;re both ab@@ use of both s@@ am@@ els
we &apos;ll come back later to these people later .
most of my time , i put two hat@@ ls on . .
and below a hat , i &apos;m working on the history of an@@ atom@@
i &apos;m a study histor@@ ian , and in this case , i study how people moved to an@@ atom@@ y -- meaning human body , animal bodies -- as they were moving through the body flu@@ id , with body concep@@ ts , how they &apos;ve thought about body flu@@ id , they &apos;ve thought about body concep@@
the other hat i &apos;ve car@@ ried at in my work is that activ@@ ist , as a de@@ human@@ i@@ tion law@@ yer -- or , i sometimes say , as a de@@ dul@@ ent law@@ yer -- of people who are patients of physi@@ cians .
in this case , i worked with people who have the social types of social nor@@ ms . , in this
so , for example , i worked with people who are in the si@@ am@@ es@@ an tw@@ ins , two people in a body . .
i &apos;ve been working with people with je@@ wel@@ er growing -- so people who were smaller than common . . . .
and many often i &apos;ve been working on sexual people whose gender is at@@ bi@@ al -- that people who are not indi@@ c@@ ating the average male or female type of body types .
and as a general word , we can use the word sexual dis@@ pos@@ al .
inter@@ sexu@@ ality comes in a lot of different forms .
i &apos;ll just give you a couple of examples of the types of sexual vari@@ ants that don &apos;t give the male or female standard .
in one case , maybe someone with a x@@ y chromo@@ some , maybe someone with a x@@ y chromo@@ some , and the s@@ ars &apos;s ch@@ om@@ o@@ za &apos;s ba@@ l , and we have the nan@@ gon@@ bot@@ ting stage of all of these . on top
and that &apos;s why the te@@ stes are spending the fe@@ mal@@ ine stage te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one .
but because this individual is missing the reci@@ pes to dete@@ ct the te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , the body re@@ acts to te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one . re@@ ac@@ tors
and that &apos;s called and@@ ro@@ gen@@ re@@ cep@@ tor . . . .
so , much te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , but not the reaction to that . .
as a result , the body develop@@ s more of the typical female trans@@ actions .
when the child is born , it looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s being raised as a girl .
but and it they &apos;s do mostly a about few taking tests the , pu@@ and ber@@ we ty find and that growing instead your of brea@@ bur@@ sts row and and developing ir@@ them ri@@ , gate but
, not you getting &apos;re their actually peri@@ holding o@@ the ks ti@@ until den somebody of comes eg@@ from gs it and that the &apos;s u@@ a ter@@ little us bit of different being . a y
and it &apos;s important to understand that you can actually hold a man , but they &apos;re not really . . .
women , like men , have some place in our body called ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine expres@@ ses . .
they &apos;re in the back part of our body .
and the si@@ bl@@ ings are and@@ ro@@ id bla@@ zing , which is vi@@ ri@@ li@@ zing hor@@ mon@@ es . .
most of the women , as i do -- i think i &apos;m a typical person -- don &apos;t do what i do , but don &apos;t think i &apos;ve got the most beautiful chromo@@ som@@ ing , but i think most women like i do speak to and@@ ro@@ vers
we produce and@@ ro@@ gen , and we &apos;re talking to and@@ ro@@ gens . .
the consequ@@ ence of that is that someone like myself actually has a brain that was ex@@ posed to more and@@ ro@@ gens than a woman who was born with ho@@ sti@@ le and has a and@@ ro@@ gen@@
so gender is really complicated because inter@@ sexual animals are not only in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , you can be about the entire range of stre@@ t@@ ches .
another example . a couple of years ago , i got the phone call of a 19 year-old man who was born as a boy , had a gir@@ l@@ friend , had sex with his gir@@ l@@ friend , lived as a man , and he just found that he had eg@@ gs and a ter@@ u@@ ri@@ al . . . . a
he had an extreme form of in@@ na@@ te c@@ u hyper@@ lo@@ y . . . .
he and &apos;s as spe@@ a cked result x@@ , x his chromo@@ gen@@ some it@@ , alia and became in un@@ the lo@@ wom@@ cked b , , his his brain si@@ was bl@@ ex@@ ings posed were to ac@@ the tively
typical so male active part that of they the would hor@@ essentially m@@ have one a spectrum male . hor@@ m@@ . one environment . . . . . . . . .
and when he was born , he looked like a guy -- no one had a
and it was only when he became 19 , he got enough medical problems , in fact , because he was intern@@ ally men@@ med that the doctors were out of the inner part of the room . a lot of the doctors found
okay , so let &apos;s give you a quick example of a vari@@ ant of inter@@ sexu@@ ality
some people with x@@ x chromo@@ some , develop something called o@@ eu@@ est@@ is , which is cor@@ rec@@ ted by ho@@ sti@@ le tissue . . . . . .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this happens . .
so gender is actually going to occu@@ r in many different ways .
the reason children with this kind of body -- whether it &apos;s z@@ ag@@ ger@@ ed or si@@ am@@ es@@ ic tw@@ ins , whether it &apos;s intern@@ ally cor@@ related about surge@@ ons , often being adap@@ ted to the nor@@ m , is not because it would be for their physical health of the benefit .
and in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason they often be given different types of sur@@ gical interven@@ tions is because they thre@@ aten our social categ@@ ories .
typically , our system is based on the idea that a specific an@@ atom@@ ic pre@@ ven@@ tion is related to a particular identity
so we have the concept that a woman is , to have a female identity , to be a female person , to be an african person means , to have an african an@@ atom@@ y in the way of their own history . . .
so we have this awful simpli@@ stic idea . .
and if we face a body that &apos;s actually very different to us , that we &apos;re conf@@ used to this categ@@ ory , and it &apos;s un@@ satis@@ fied that
so and we our have nation a is lot really of based roman@@ on tic a ideas very
in roman@@ our tic culture concept about of individu@@ individu@@ alism alism . . . .
now , you can imagine how amazing it is when children are born , that are two people in a body . . . .
i &apos;ve been experi@@ en@@ cing most of the time , the south african run@@ ner ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya last year , whose gender was challen@@ ged by the blin@@ ch@@ at@@ ic world ma@@ ster@@ y in ber@@
many journ@@ alists were called me asking me , &quot; what are they going to do , who will tell us whether ca@@ ster se@@ th@@ ya is indi@@ c@@ ally or male ? &quot; ? &quot; ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journalist that there &apos;s no one test . .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to ad@@ mit that nature doesn &apos;t deser@@ ve to us , not to the line of men , or from a female and a dis@@ ambi@@ ti@@ ally and female and dis@@ pos@@ al , or den@@ sity ,
so we have this situation where , as we go forward , the further we &apos;re going to continue , we have to stand up with the more that these categ@@ ories that we had thought about to be an@@ atom@@ ical categ@@ ories , which are very simple to creating un@@ fortun@@ ate patterns of identity , much more dist@@ ant than
and that &apos;s not just true of gender . .
it &apos;s also race , which is a lot more complicated than our ter@@ min@@ ology has failed . . . .
we &apos;re at our vie@@ wer at all sorts of un@@ comfortable regi@@ ons .
for example , we push in the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanze@@ es . .
what should we do with the fact that we &apos;re just getting through little nu@@ cle@@ o@@ ti@@ de ? ? ? ?
as we continue to move our science forward , we &apos;re increasingly moving into a field of un@@ com@@ pati@@ sel@@ ing , where we have to recognize that the simpli@@ stic categ@@ ories we probably have are too simple . . . .
we see it in all sorts of different fields of human life . .
one of the areas that we &apos;re seeing to be in our culture today , in our current culture today , are the struggle of the very beginning and the end of life . . .
we have a tough conver@@ sa@@ tions on what point is a body that will be a human being , so that he has a different right than the fe@@ tal living
we have a lot of hard argu@@ ments today -- maybe not as public as in medicine -- about asking when you &apos;re dead . question : when you &apos;re dead .
our ance@@ stors had never been so hard to fight with the question when someone was dead . . .
you &apos;ve got somebody &apos;s high fe@@ a@@ thers to be held under the nose , and if they moved , they haven &apos;t bur@@ ned them . .
if they don &apos;t move it , they have bu@@ ried .
but we are now in a situation where we &apos;re taking people living organs and want to put them to other people . .
and we &apos;re going to leave the world &apos;s fight with the really difficult question when someone is dead , and it brings us a really difficult situation in which we have no longer categ@@ ory as simple as we used to be . . as
now , you might think that the whole thing is , of course , is to make categ@@ ories of one thing
i &apos;m a political pro@@ gressi@@ ve , i &apos;m de@@ gressi@@ ve people with unusual bodies , but i have to ad@@ mit , it makes me nervous . .
to understand that these categ@@ ories are really a lot more inse@@ cure than we thought , does me .
and it makes me think about re@@ consi@@ der@@ ations that democracy is about . .
so to tell you about this ten@@ sion , i first know that i &apos;m a big fan of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers . . . . .
i know they were ra@@ c@@ alized , i know they were se@@ xi@@ sts , but they were great .
i think they were so strong and strong , and so radical , in what they were doing , i &apos;m going to clim@@ b up all the many years , the drawing kid 17@@ 7@@ 6 , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely for@@ gotten . . .
it &apos;s because of what happened with the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers in 17@@ 7@@ 6 .
the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers have been made up of my view , the original an@@ atom@@ ic activi@@ sts , and that &apos;s why .
what they had been re@@ stra@@ ined was an an@@ atom@@ ical concept , and they put it through another species that was radi@@ cally and beauti@@ fully and 200 years
as you all remember , our gre@@ ed fa@@ thers re@@ je@@ cted the concept of mon@@ arch@@ y , and the mon@@ arch@@ y based on the bottom was based on an@@ atom@@ y . a very simpli@@ fied concept of an@@ atom@@
the old world of ancient world didn &apos;t have any concept based on dna , but they had a concept of birth right . .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who had political power were supposed to have these political power because of the grand@@ father &apos;s father and the son to the son and so forth . .
the they fo@@ li@@ unding sted fa@@ the thers game , field it , &apos;s and got decided this that idea the back sur@@ and ger@@ re@@ ol stor@@ of ing the it com@@ through mon@@ a s new were an@@ , atom@@ the ical common
concept com@@ , mon@@ and s this , idea the said common that com@@ all mon@@ humans s were , being the equ@@ differences ally , created and . it was . very radi@@ a cally concept . said that . all
now they did it in part because they were part of an en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment system in which two things came together . .
democracy grew , but at the same time , the science grew up too . as well .
if you look at the history of the green fa@@ thers , you can see that many of you were very creative about science , and they were interested in a concept of a science world . . . .
they went from explan@@ ations of natural natural species , and things like a super@@ natural concept of power , back to where the trans@@ mission is based on a very va@@ stly va@@ gue concep@@ ts of birth . .
they moved to a natural concept . . .
and for example , if you look at the indepen@@ dence of indepen@@ dence , you talk about nature and the god of nature . .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature . .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are . .
and as part of that , they managed to make us a concept that was made by an@@ atom@@ ic com@@ pla@@ int .
and they have a really wonderful way to do the future of civil rights movement . . . .
they don &apos;t think it was great , but what they did for us was great . . .
so what did years after that have been
for example , women used the vote right , the concept of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers , saying that an@@ atom@@ ic com@@ pre@@ hen@@ si@@ als matter more than an@@ atom@@ ic causes , and said an@@ atom@@ ic com@@ pre@@ hen@@ si@@ ble is not important that we don &apos;t have the vot@@ ing right to have the vot@@ ing right to have the vot@@ ing right to own , which is right , etc . , etc . &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot;
and women were argu@@ ing that success@@ fully .
next was the successful civil rights movement , where we looked at people like so@@ ars , who are like , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the mar@@ sh@@ ing ti@@ les of the western movement , saying , &quot; i &apos;m a man .
again , people , different skin color , which de@@ als on an@@ atom@@ ic com@@ mon@@ ality , to an@@ atom@@ ical differences , again , successful .
we see the same thing with dis@@ ab@@ led law movement .
the problem is , as we start to look at all the simil@@ ali@@ ties , we need to start asking ourselves to question why we main@@ tain certain separ@@ ations . . .
now , comfort , i want to main@@ tain certain sli@@ des , an@@ atom@@ ically , in our culture . .
i want to give you a fish , for example , not the same rights as a person .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take the an@@ atom@@ y off .
i so don there &apos;t are want some to an@@ say atom@@ that ic five dis@@ year-@@ orders ol@@ that ds make are sense right for
to me have , their and own that commit@@ i ment think to we sex should or keep to re@@ get per@@ married toi@@ . re
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is and why we keep it , and whether they &apos;re meaning@@ ful .
so let &apos;s go back to those two creatures that have been actually being simp@@ ed in the beginning of
we &apos;ve been two creatures , both in the middle of 197@@ 9 , exactly . . . .
so let &apos;s imagine that one of them , mar@@ ia , three months was born by the last jun@@ e , so it &apos;s on the third of 19@@ 80
h@@ ein@@ rich , on the other hand , is born for the birth@@ place , so he &apos;s born on the 1 mar@@
just because of the fact that mar@@ ia was born three months , they get all sorts of rights , they get three months before h@@ ein@@ an@@ di@@ ans -- have a fair sex , right to drink right , right ? . . . .
h@@ ein@@ rich has to be waiting for all this , not because he &apos;s actually got another bi@@ ologi@@ cally , only by the time of the pres@@ entation of his birth
we find other od@@ di@@ ties to what they are with their rights . .
h@@ ein@@ rich , because you think he &apos;s a male -- although i don &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s a male -- that you assu@@ me that he &apos;s male , he can now get her@@ ed , which mar@@ ia does not have to worry about . . . . .
mar@@ ia , despite all states , is not the same right to say that h@@ ein@@ rich has the same right , which has h@@ ein@@ rich to mar@@ ry in
h@@ ein@@ rich can mar@@ ry a woman , but mar@@ ia can only mar@@ ry a woman in a few states , but mar@@
so we have this continu@@ ous an@@ atom@@ ical categ@@ ories that are proble@@ matic and frag@@ ment@@ ally challen@@ ged in many ways .
and to me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science is going to power this advan@@ c@@ ement in the ab@@ und@@ ance of an@@ atom@@ y , that we have to get to a point where we have to be in fact meeting that democracy , that
i don &apos;t want to give up science , but at the same time it feels like science is making self-@@ interest . . . as it does
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture is a kind of pra@@ g@@ matic stance , &quot; okay , we must pull a line , so we just count it in place . &quot; . &quot; . &quot;
but a lot of people are con@@ ta@@ ined in a very strange position
so for example , texas was asking at a point that if you had a man to mar@@ ry a man means you don &apos;t have y chromo@@ some , and to mar@@ ry a woman means you have a y chromo@@ me . . . .
now in practice , people are not testing on their chromo@@ some . .
but it &apos;s also very bizar@@ re because of the story i told you about the and@@ ro@@ gens re@@ cep@@ tor re@@ cep@@ tor . .
if we look at one of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers of modern democracy , dr. martin lu@@ ther king , he off@@ ers us in his &quot; i have a dream . &quot; an answer . a
he says we should not ask people to be &quot; their skin , &quot; but the property of their character , &quot; they ju@@ dge it , and they go beyond an@@ atom@@
and i want to say , &quot; yes , it sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ? ?
how do you get people from their characters ? properties ? how
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should put on the rights of people in terms of people because i have to ad@@ mit that i know i &apos;ve heard a series of gol@@ den re@@ tri@@ ever@@ s , which probably deser@@ ves so@@ on@@ ers more than some people i know .
i want to argue that i probably know some bright lab@@ s of lab@@ s , the capable of capable of fun@@ er@@ al , intelligent , ri@@ gi@@ d decisions about their sexual rela@@ tions than for a few years , i know .
so how are we going to organi@@ ze the question of the characteri@@ stics of the
it turns out that it &apos;s really difficult .
and a part of me wonder@@ ing what if the content of a person@@ ality is something that would be machine read@@ able in the future -- can i recognize visible by the f@@ mr@@ i ?
do we really want to go to that one
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it seems really important to think about the idea that the united states is about making up the question of democracy . questions . .
in our en@@ dea@@ vor for democracy , we &apos;ve done a really good job , and i think we &apos;d be doing it well in
we don &apos;t have the situation of , for example , in the iran , where a man who feels sex@@ ually in other men is the death of a man , unless it &apos;s ready to raise an ob@@ li@@ gation , which case he can stay alive in which case he can stay
and these sorts of states exist at us .
i &apos;m happy to say that we don &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon that i spoke a few years ago who had some cam@@ ans@@ ian tw@@ ins had brought to separate them , par@@ tly to make a name . , par@@ tly , to make a name .
but when i was talking to him , and i asked him why he made these interven@@ tions -- it was highly ris@@ ky sur@@ ger@@ ies -- his answer was that in his country , these children would be very poor , and so he had to do it . . . , he had
i said , &quot; well , you have political as@@ yl@@ l in argu@@ ement , rather than having surgery to separate them ? &quot;
the united states im@@ per@@ ative opportunities to allow people to be the ones they are without the state of the state . . . . . . .
so i think we need to be a leader . .
well , just to conclu@@ de , i want to conclu@@ de that i talked to a lot of the fa@@ thers . .
and i want to think about the ways in which democracy might look , or have looked like democracy , if we were involved in the mothers . .
and i want to say something that &apos;s a fe@@ min@@ ist , and that &apos;s what i think is a very radical way of thinking about , in particular , that i think there might be different ways of as@@ pi@@ re that will protect from different types of an@@ atom@@
for years , because i was interested in intern@@ al sexu@@ ality , i &apos;ve also interested in the field of gender .
and one of the things that actually found interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and how they act in the world . . . . .
what we &apos;ve learned from cultural studies is that women , on average -- not every one , but on average -- more are they tend to be more complex relationships and the care for people that are vulnerable to the group , a lot of attention . . . .
and so , if we think about it , we have an interesting situation in front of us
years ago , when i was growing up , one of my graduate students , who was interested in fe@@ min@@ ism -- i considered a fe@@ min@@ ist , so does it do -- is it -- a really curious question . . .
he said , &quot; tell me what &apos;s in the fe@@ min@@ ism of mar@@ king . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the stu@@ pi@@ dest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
in fe@@ min@@ ism , the v@@ acc@@ yp@@ es are about solving gender on gender , so on the fe@@ min@@ ism is not female . in
but the more i thought about it , to think about the more , that i thought there could be some female in the fe@@ min@@
this is to say that it could be something , on average , where female brains of male dist@@ ingu@@ ished different things that make us more complex social relationships , and car@@ ing for the protection for the protection . .
so where the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers were extremely inten@@ ded to find out how individuals could be prote@@ cted from the state , it &apos;s possible that if we were to co@@ ok more mothers into this concept , we &apos;ll be able to give a concept , not just how to protect , but how we can care for
and maybe that is where we &apos;re going to go to the future when we &apos;re going to take democracy out of an@@ atom@@ y -- less about the individual body , to think more about the individual body , and to think more about
so that if we were to make a perfect connection as people , we &apos;re thinking about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m j@@ ess@@ i , and this is my su@@ it@@ case .
but before i show you what i &apos;m going to do , i &apos;m going to make a very public conf@@ ession , and that is , i &apos;m obs@@ essed with out@@ f@@ its
i love to find a different far@@ m@@ up , crazy out@@ fit , and in the last time , i still cap@@ tured and blog@@ ging . .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clo@@ th@@ es out of my two-@@ hand hand on ro@@ und@@ land , in the standard
o@@ oh , thank you .
use hand@@ -@@ sh@@ opp@@ ing de@@ fe@@ ating to reduce the impact of my mind on the environment , and also to the bo@@ b@@ ging
i meet all kinds of good people ; my dollars for good for good , i see a good deal for it , and it &apos;s buying in my very personal sha@@ ping . a little bit of kin@@ dness
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
will am my i size going have to ?
like the ? color ? ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers are yes , i feel like i &apos;ve ga@@ ined .
i come back to my su@@ it@@ case , and tell you what i did here at ted this exciting week here at ted .
i so mean i , &apos;m what going &apos;s to going show to you get exactly someone
what with i so &apos;ve many brought out@@ . f@@ its . ? .
i &apos;ve brought in seven characters , and that &apos;s all . .
and in fact , under@@ wear for just one week , i &apos;ve done it in my su@@ it@@
i was spe@@ arch@@ ing that i would wear anything else that i could wear if i first came to pal@@ m spr@@ ings . . .
and because of the time she &apos;s heard of me when the woman who &apos;s running around here at ted in her under@@ wear -- is that
and i &apos;d like to show you my out@@ f@@ its for this week . . .
does that sound well ?
and i also will do that as i &apos;m doing that , some of the lessons i have , whether you believe it or not , have learned from these ad@@ vent@@ ures , nothing new . .
let &apos;s start with sun@@ day . .
i call this the bright tiger . . .
you you don can &apos;t almost have always to look spend terri@@ a fic lot
for of less money than to 50 look dollars really . good . .
this whole out@@ fit , including the jac@@ ket , which costs me 5@@ 5 , and it was the most expensive piece that i had car@@ ried in this week .
mon@@ day : color is a little more
it &apos;s almost physi@@ ologi@@ cally impossible , and it &apos;s very , very sti@@ cky if you &apos;re wearing light red pants
when you &apos;re happy , you lose other happy people . happy people . .
tu@@ es@@ day : adap@@ tation is totally over@@ wh@@ el@@ med .
i &apos;ve spent a lot of time trying to be in my life trying to be myself , and ada@@ pt to
just be who you are .
if you surro@@ und yourself with the right people , not only do they know it ; they &apos;re also appreci@@ ating it .
you &apos;re in the we@@ dn@@ as : embra@@ ce your inner
sometimes people say i look rather than i look , i look like i &apos;m going to play the games , or i can remember them . &quot;
i just smile and i say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
th@@ ur@@ s@@ day : confidence is the key .
if you think you &apos;re looking good , it &apos;s almost safe . .
and if you think you &apos;re not looking good at something , you probably have to have a right
i but grew it up was with only a when mother i who turned taught 30 me , the
i day really for understood day what . that means . . . .
and i &apos;m going to sum@@ mar@@ ize that for a second . .
if you think you &apos;re a wonderful person inside and out of your life , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t carry .
so there &apos;s no exc@@ use for someone here in this audience . here .
we should be able to squ@@ int what we want . .
thank you .
a total of a universal truth : a universal truth -- gol@@ den pa@@ il@@ le@@ tes to everything .
and finally , satur@@ day : one own , unique , personal style is a great way to tell the world something about one , without having to say a word .
it &apos;s been pro@@ ven to me over and over again , when this week , people came to me just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conver@@ sa@@ tions . .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit all of my little su@@ it@@ case . .
so before i go home to bro@@ o@@ kl@@ yn , i &apos;m going to take it back to all of
because the lesson i &apos;ve been learning this week is that it &apos;s okay to leave . . .
i don &apos;t have to reas@@ it this stuff emotion@@ ally because , in the same way , it &apos;ll always be a different crazy , color@@ ful , radiation out@@ fit that wa@@ ited for me when i love a little bit of love in a heart and make it look for
thank you very much .
thank you .
good after@@ noon , everybody .
i have something i want to show you .
think of this as a visual do@@ main . . . .
that &apos;s what we call in our lab , we call it com@@ pre@@ hen@@
let me tell you a little bit about this .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m origin@@ ally itali@@ an , and every young in it@@ al@@ y gro@@ ws up in his room in his room , but the reason i show you this is to show that in the for@@ mul@@ a 1 over the last several decades , something very interesting happened . . in
so a while ago , if you wanted to win a for@@ mul@@ a a morning , then they took their budget and put money on a good driver and a good car . a good
and if the car was good enough , they won the race . . wa@@ wa@@ days
now , now , if you want to win a race , if you want to win a race , something like this -- something that the car will monit@@ or in real time , some thousand sensor@@ s have the information that &apos;s coming in , and then you process them to help make decisions in real time through information , and then you process them to help make decisions in real time through information . in real time ,
this would be called , in engineering teams , a re@@ al-@@ time control system . .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that is made of two parts -- a part of a part and a re@@ actor
what &apos;s interesting today is that re@@ al-@@ time re@@ plac@@ ement systems start to take up in our
our cities became , in the last few years , just equi@@ pped with networks and electr@@ on@@ ics . .
they become the free computer . . .
and as a computer , they start to re@@ act in a different way , and they &apos;re percei@@ ved and driven . . . . .
and if we are to come up with cities , it &apos;s actually
i want to mention just two percent of the world &apos;s land , but 50 percent of the population are living there . 50 percent of the population there are . .
they &apos;re about 75 percent of the energy consumption -- cause to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , it &apos;s a big deal . .
beyond the cities , all this percei@@ ve and en@@ h@@ ance in the objects of life .
this is from an exhi@@ bi@@ tion that &apos;s called pa@@ ol@@ a ant@@ on@@ ell@@ i , for mom@@ a , later in the summer , organized .
it &apos;s called &quot; spr@@ and@@ y with me .
well , all of our objects , our environment , start to talk back to
in a sense , it &apos;s almost like each one of the one atoms get out there , a sen@@ sor and a ca@@ po@@ ver .
and that changes radi@@ cally the interaction that we have with our environment . . .
in a way , it &apos;s almost as if the old dream is mi@@ ch@@ el@@ angel@@ o ... ...
you know , as mi@@ ch@@ el@@ angel@@ o formed the mo@@ ses , it means that he would take the ham@@ mer at the end and thre@@ w it on mo@@ ses -- in fact , you can still see a little bit of pain -- and said , &quot; per@@ ch@@ é n@@ on par@@ l@@ i ? why don &apos;t you spend ? &quot; bla@@
well , today , our environment starts to respond to us , respon@@ ses first . .
i &apos;m just going to show you a few examples -- again , to embra@@ ce our environment and to embra@@ ce it .
let &apos;s start with the sense .
now the first project i want to share with you is one of the first ever our lab@@ s . .
it was born four and a half ago in it@@ al@@ y .
and what we &apos;ve done was actually a new kind of re@@ lief to use a new kind of network that was being applied to all over the world -- this is a mobile phone network -- and it &apos;s in@@ struc@@ tional information from that network that &apos;s being colle@@ cted from the cour@@ ty@@ s to understand how the city works . . .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was as it@@ al@@ y as it@@ al@@ y la@@ sted the foot@@ ball
some of you remember , it was in love as it@@ al@@ y , against fr@@ ance , and then at the end of the head , the head rus@@ h
and it &apos;s not , it &apos;s a rul@@ er .
now , look at what happened that day , only by watching the activity that &apos;s going on in
here you see the city .
you can see in the middle that &apos;s the giant , the sc@@ ore ti@@ ber .
it &apos;s on the morning before the game .
you see the ti@@ mel@@ ine . . .
early after@@ noon , people here and here , the calls were making and moving
the game starts -- sil@@ ent .
fr@@ ance makes an a@@ partment . it makes a port@@ -@@ .
hal@@ f-@@ time , people make a little call , go to toi@@ let . .
second half time . end of the old play
ini@@ tially , second exten@@ sion ,
ci@@ d@@ e , in a moment of head . .
it@@ al@@ y w@@ . yeah . .
well , that night , they would all go to the center to celebra@@ te
they saw the great impact .
the next day , they would all go to the center around the se@@ ct@@ mate team and the prime minister at the same time
and then everyone went down .
you see the picture of the place of mars , where the ro@@ man time , where the ro@@ man time , people go to celebra@@ te , to have a great party , and you can see the impact on the day . .
well , this is just one example of how we can feel the city in a way that we couldn &apos;t have done a few years ago . in a
even more , for feeling , this isn &apos;t about people , it &apos;s not about people , but about things we use
now , today we know about where our things are coming . .
this is a map that shows you all the chi@@ ps that have a ma@@ c computer , how they came together .
but we just know just about where things go .
so in this project , we &apos;ve designed some very small mar@@ ker to track the tr@@ ash as he goes through the system
so we started with some volunte@@ ers a little more than a year ago , and we helped us do something more than a year ago , in se@@ attle , who would pick things up -- various types of things you can see -- things you might throw away .
and then we have little chi@@ ps that were sc@@ ra@@ ped out little br@@ ands , that little br@@ ands
so here are the results we &apos;ve got right now .
from after se@@ a attle
week ... .
with this information , we realized there &apos;s a lot of in@@ efficient things in the system .
we can actually do the same things in the fact that we do
the data was not available before .
but that &apos;s happening a lot of things , and it &apos;s compli@@ mented things . complicated
but the other thing about the other thing is that we think that if we see every day , the c@@ up we throw away , not just disappe@@ ared , that it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet
and the plastic bottle that we all throw away every day . . .
and if we were to show that to people , then we can pro@@ mote behavior change . .
so that &apos;s the project for this project .
my collea@@ gue at mit at mit could be more about reading , and the many other wonderful things you can percei@@ ve with percei@@ ve , but i want to talk to you in the second part of the world that we were discus@@ sing at the beginning and that &apos;s the em@@ pathy of our environment .
and the first project is something we did in ye@@ a@@ go@@ za , spa@@ in . in spa@@ a@@ go@@ za
and it began with a question of the ma@@ yo@@ r , who came to us and said that sp@@ in and southern europe have a beautiful tradition of water in the public level of architecture as part of architecture
and the question was : how could you bring technology , new technology ? a technology ?
and one of the ideas that was done at mit in a work@@ force was , you know , imagine this pi@@ g , and val@@ ve , magnetic li@@ le , val@@ ks , open and close . . .
they cause something like a can@@ op@@ y of the audi@@ ences of water .
if these ima@@ ging falls down , they can write on the patterns , images , text . . .
and you can approach it , and it will open up to make you go through this picture as you can see . .
well , we pres@@ ented the ma@@ yo@@ r of bel@@ hole .
it &apos;s got very lo@@ aded .
and we got the mission to design the exp@@ o building . . . . .
we called it the digital water of pa@@ vili@@ on
the whole building was under@@ water . .
there are no to@@ ors or windows , but if you approach them , it &apos;s going to open up and put it in
the roof was covered with water too .
and if it &apos;s w@@ ic@@ l@@ ly , if you want to reduce the sy@@ r@@ inge , you can even let the roof down .
or you could just tun@@ e the building , and the whole architecture , like in this case , you know , this date , that time , when you dro@@ ve up the roof , you get pictures of people that were there and saying , &quot; you &apos;ve destro@@ yed the building .
no , they didn &apos;t break the building , it &apos;s just that architecture disappe@@ ars . . . .
so here &apos;s how the building works
you see the person who asks what happens inside . . .
and here you see me looking at the testing of sensor@@ s that opened the water , not getting we@@ t
now , if i should tell you what happened one night when all the sen@@ ses were stopped . .
but it was actually a more much fun fun night .
all the g@@ a@@ go@@ za &apos;s children came to the building , because the way they play with the building was quite different . .
no and longer that a was building , that for would us open , to very allow exciting you , to because allow as you architec@@ to ts do , one engineers , , but as a designers building
, that we still always has think p@@ about ings how and people holes who in use the things water we , design you . had to . go to . just getting . we@@
but the reality is always un@@ predi@@ c@@ table .
and that &apos;s the beauty of creating things that are used and inter@@ acting with the people
here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical ima@@ ging points , the ima@@ ging points of water and the proje@@ ctions on it . . .
and this is what brought us to this project that &apos;s been going on for you now .
imagine this kind of ima@@ gery , you could actually start flying .
imagine you could have small hu@@ b@@ bs that fly through the air , and each of you with a little graphic of your light , your light , you can move through it almost like a cloud .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a heli@@ cop@@ ter , like the one you saw earlier , that moves with others , totally syn@@ c . syn@@
you can have this cloud . .
you can have a kind of a flexi@@ ble screen or a tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory , like this one -- an equal forma@@ tion
or even un@@ reg@@ ul@@ ated , as what &apos;s changing , the light is not the position of the ima@@ ging . . .
they can play with different species . .
imagine the screen just appe@@ ars in different forma@@ ts or si@@ zes , in different resol@@ ution . dem@@
but then , it could just be a 3d cloud of sculp@@ tures that you can go to and through which you move through , which you can see from many , many
here &apos;s a real fl@@ y@@ fi@@ d-@@ wing control that goes down like that , which is a smo@@
when you turn on the lights , it looks like this . so the way we saw it before .
imagine that every single person is car@@ ed by .
it could have a pul@@ se to have a pul@@ se of every single vision that comes from people , the movements of the people or
i want to show you something about it . . .
we worked with ro@@ ber@@ to bol@@ le , who &apos;s one of the greatest bal@@ let dan@@ cers of our time -- the colle@@ c@@ tr@@ le on the me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan theater in new york , and the sc@@ ala in ma@@ il@@ an -- we took his movement in 3d sam@@ ple to use it as a pul@@ se
here you see ro@@ ber@@ to dan@@ cing . .
on the le@@ ft@@ -@@ hand side , you see the graphi@@ cs , the different inter@@ faces .
it &apos;s at the same time , and a re@@ al-@@ time 3d scan
so you can get all the movement to begin .
you can do that all the time .
but then , once we have the ima@@ ging points , you can play and play with color motion and turn it . . . .
we want to use this as a potential impul@@ se for the river . a kind of a
i want to show you the lat@@ est project we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something that we &apos;re working on for the olymp@@ ics in london
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the
so , the idea is , again , imagine this , we can put the people involved in something , change the environment -- almost something like this , as we call the cloud , we &apos;re using a scan@@ ning in@@ cen@@ se
imagine that everybody can give a little don@@ ation for a point . . .
i think that the remarkable part of the last few years has been that we &apos;ve changed from a physical world , and we &apos;ve changed from a physical world . . . .
this has all di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed , knowledge , and it &apos;s acc@@ essi@@ ble by the internet . .
now , for the first time , we can do the first time -- and the campaign can@@ ell@@ as has shown this -- we can now move from the digital world , from self-@@ organi@@ zing forces of
this can be , in our case , we use it to design and to create a symbol . .
that &apos;s something that &apos;s built in the city
but tomorrow can it , to give us the challenges -- think about climate change , or the co2 emissions -- how do we go from the digital world to the physical shift . . . .
so the idea is that we actually engage the people in which they put things together together , colle@@ c@@ tively
and the cloud again is a cloud of sculp@@ tures , in the same way that the actual cloud is a cloud of particles . . .
and it these &apos;s particles a are physical water type , of while physics our in cloud london
is , a but cloud it of &apos;s sculp@@ covered tures with . ima@@ ging . points
you can move inside of the inside and make different kinds of
you can actually share it from the bottom , the most important moments for publi@@ city in 20@@ 12 and share it as a kind of connection to community . . .
so both the physics cloud in the sky and something that you can go about the top , like live of new min@@ ing p@@ ings . .
you can go in . .
and a kind of digital glo@@ g that night -- but the most important , a new kind of experience for anybody who &apos;s going to go to the top .
thank you .
so as an artist , i &apos;m very important to the context
i &apos;m trying to express that people are not separate from nature , and that everything is inter@@ connected . . .
the first time i was seeing in ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , where i saw my first ic@@ e@@ en . .
i &apos;m dre@@ aming of a@@ we
my heart was a li@@ int , and i was trying to figure out what was in front of me . . . what i was
the ic@@ e@@ berg to put me in my feet almost 60 feet from water , and i could just st@@ ack out that this was a sna@@ vel fla@@ g on a different s@@ no@@ w@@ fla@@ ke year , year after year . after
ice mountains are born as cal@@ f of a gl@@ aci@@ er or by breaking out ice she@@ ets . . .
every ic@@ e@@ berg has its own individual person@@ ality .
they &apos;re mani@@ pul@@ ating their environment in both ways with their environment and their experiences .
some of the re@@ f@@ ers to come up and make c@@ ites and s@@ nu@@ ts , while others don &apos;t mind it , and they collapse in a dra@@ matic , dra@@ matic passion
when you look at the ic@@ e@@ berg , you just think about it that they are isol@@ ated , separ@@ ated and alone , just as we humans see us . . as we humans
but the truth is far away from it .
as a ice ch@@ un@@ k mel@@ ts , i paint its current atmosphere . .
it mel@@ tes down in the ch@@ un@@ k of miner@@ al drin@@ king water , which is rele@@ as@@ ing a lot of life forms . .
i &apos;m going to go on my ch@@ al@@ ter to do this col@@ o@@ e@@ ge , as if i do portra@@ its of my ance@@ stors , knowing that they exist in this individual e@@ ye@@ ball , and
it &apos;s not a death when you melt ; it &apos;s not a end , it &apos;s a pro@@ creation of your path across the life cycle .
part of the ice in the ice mountains that i &apos;m photograph@@ ing is very young -- a few thousand years old .
and some of the ice is more than 100,000 years ago .
the last pictures that i &apos;d like to show you , is an ic@@ e@@ berg that i photograph@@ ed in ke@@ om@@ n@@ su@@ at@@ si@@ ak in green@@ land .
very rare , you &apos;re going to be extin@@ ct , a roll@@ ing ice mountain . . .
here &apos;s what it looks like
on the left there , you see a little boat .
that &apos;s about five meters long . .
please watch the shape of the ic@@ e@@ berg and where it &apos;s in the water line . . . . .
you can see here , it starts to roll , and the boat is moving on the other side , the guy is there . the guy
this it is &apos;s the about average 120 size feet of from a the green@@ water house
, ice or mountain 40 . feet . . . . .
and this video is real time .
and just so , showing you the ice row a different side of his person@@ ality . .
thank you .
my life is really ex@@ cep@@ tional by the work of some amazing projects . . . . .
but the cool@@ est thing i &apos;ve ever worked on , it was this
his name is fast . . his
mt was one of the leading gra@@ ff@@ iti artists that &apos; 8@@ 0s did . .
then , one day , he came back from running , and he said , &quot; dad , my legs cr@@ b@@ ap@@ ing .
and mt that is was fully the paraly@@ out@@ zed
break by of paraly@@ that zed . .
he can only use his eyes . .
i was standing there . .
so i have a company , the design and anima@@ tion , is inevi@@ table is inevi@@ table as a complex part of what we ad@@ mi@@ re in the art world and look at it
so we decided to go and do tony -- and to support his thing . . . .
and i met with his father and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money . .
what are you going to do with this ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk again to tony . . .
i just want to leave you again with him and i said , &quot; wait a minute that &apos;s not -- i &apos;ve seen ste@@ phen haw@@ king watching -- can &apos;t all of you guys have all these devices involved ? &quot; ? &quot; ?
and he said , &quot; no , just if you &apos;re hearing the market , and you &apos;ve got a remarkable in@@ sur@@ ance , you can actually do it . in@@ sur@@ ance
people are not available to these devices . &quot; . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot; communic@@ ating now
anybody saw the movie &quot; bu@@ tter@@ fly and di@@ ve glo@@ ve ? &quot; ?
so they communicate -- they walk along -- they walk along .
i was like , &quot; very arch@@ a@@ ic , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came up with the need to just take a check and instead i got a check out , and i got a check that i had not really re@@ com@@ promis@@ ed him .
i was taking a place to go to the place to his brother and his father -- with the words , &quot; okay , my pro@@ pos@@ al is so that he &apos;s going to get this machine , and we &apos;ll find a way to make his art . &quot; . . . .
because it &apos;s a far@@ ming , somebody who &apos;s going to take this room , not communicate . &quot; . &quot; farm . &quot;
so i was talking to a couple of months later at a conference
i met these guys from gr@@ ance , gra@@ ff@@ iti &apos;s research lab , and they have a technology that lets them project a light on any surface , and then to put a las@@ er poin@@ ter that is just regi@@ ster@@ ed to the negative area . .
so they &apos;re pul@@ ling around and doing the work instal@@ lations like
they say all things that are being put up up there are to follow a life cycle
it starts with the sex members , then the p@@ ine rules , after the bush of the bus@@ h , and the last , actually , is the art .
but there was always a life cycle in their pres@@ ent@@ ations .
so i went home and ate with my wife , and i was telling her of all , and we thought , &quot; well , well , wait a las@@ er , &quot; well , then , wait this technology , that you can use your eyes to control things , we should figure out a way to get it to be able to deliver a las@@ er las@@ er , so he can be a kind of great thing
that &apos;s the beginning of the journey
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of things , we &apos;ve achie@@ ved a few things . . .
first , we have the in@@ sur@@ ance that the do@@ ors have cho@@ sen in , and actually have a device that they can communicate for -- ste@@ phen haw@@ king machine . .
this was incredible . .
and he &apos;s really , really funny -- i call it yo@@ da because you talk to him , or he &apos;s going to have an email , and you &apos;re thinking , &quot; i &apos;m so un@@ comfortable , this guy is incredible . &quot; . &quot; ,
and also , we fle@@ w seven co@@ mm@@ ers from all over the world -- literally from all the cor@@ ners of the world -- to us , back to
my wife , my children and i are in the garage , and these ha@@ ck@@ ers and progra@@ mm@@ ers and con@@ spi@@ ra@@ cy and the con@@ spi@@ ra@@ cy of our house , and we &apos;ve
many of our friends thought we were beautiful du@@ m@@ b to do this , and we &apos;d be thro@@ wing back all the images to the walls , and the gra@@ ff@@ iti would be just wei@@ gh@@ ted
but for about two weeks , we &apos;ve progra@@ mm@@ ed , we went to the beach in ven@@ ice , my kids were educ@@ ated , my dog was also , and we created this .
it &apos;s called e@@ ye@@ writer , and you can see the descri@@ ption . .
this is a cheap sun@@ glas@@ ses that we bought at the beach of ven@@ ice , and some cop@@ per wire , and some of the things that are coming from the construction market and the electr@@ on@@ ics
we took a p@@ s@@ 3 camera , put it apart , put it on a du@@ de , and now we put it on a du@@ de , and now we have a device that &apos;s fre@@ ely available -- you can build it yourself , we make the code available to
so we created a device that &apos;s completely free of limit@@ ations . .
no in@@ sur@@ ance can make a source . . . .
no hospital . . . . .
now everyone paraly@@ zed now with his eyes or draw or draw . . . .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible . . .
so at the end of two weeks , we went back in temp@@ t room . .
i love this picture , because it &apos;s someone &apos;s room , and that &apos;s his room .
now there &apos;s all this ru@@ b@@ ble from the great re@@ vel@@ ation . a great re@@ vel@@ ation .
and over a year of planning , two weeks of progra@@ mming , no@@ del@@ ear@@ ties and dee@@ ps were , after the first time , he was going to be after seven years . after
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he &apos;s looking at his life support system .
we have exp@@ and@@ ed his bed so that it can see outside
we put a proje@@ ctor against a wall of the park against the hospital . a hospital . .
and he was dre@@ aming again for the first time , in the ed@@ ges of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what a feeling that was on the par@@
and so , funny enough we had to break into the par@@ king lot , so we felt at the best part of the cla@@ im scene . . . .
and he was in the end of the day , he was going to give us an email with the content : &quot; for the first time in seven years , i &apos;ve spe@@ wn .
i feel like i was po@@ uring under@@ water and finally got to the bottom , and i &apos;d come down and dra@@ wn my head to brea@@ the
isn &apos;t that amazing ? ?
this is something like our fighting struggle . .
that kee@@ ps us and always pro@@ gr@@ ess@@ ing and evol@@ ving .
and we need to be impro@@ ving a lot of time . .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s the magic of the magic board . . .
and someone who has a such arti@@ stic potential deser@@ ves so much more . .
so we &apos;re in finding out how to make it better and more and more . . . .
since that time , we &apos;ve received all sorts of appreci@@ ation . .
we won some pri@@ zes . . .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deser@@ ves it . . .
it &apos;s all made out of our own po@@ ckets .
so the ex@@ pos@@ ures were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
arm@@ strong twitter ro@@ unded over us , and then in dec@@ ember , the ti@@ me@@ -@@ magazine has been or@@ dered us , as one of the 50 best inven@@ tions , which was really
and the cool@@ est thing about this -- and this inclu@@ des the whole circle -- that there was this ap@@ ri@@ l , the mur@@ dered mo@@ ca in the inner city of los angeles , is called a show called the &quot; kind of the streets . &quot; . . . .
and there &apos;s probably going to be the tou@@ gh@@ est repres@@ ent@@ a@@ tives of the street scene , and the message is that ban@@ ks , she@@ par@@ d fa@@ i@@ re@@ y , ca@@ v -- all these guys will be there . .
mt is going to be part of the show , which is pretty fre@@ e@@ ful .
so basically , if you look a little bit , you can do that , that &apos;s impossible , it makes
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this micro@@ phone , the e@@ ye@@ writer -- it was impossible at some point .
make it possible -- all of you here .
i &apos;m not a program@@ mer , and i &apos;ve never had anything to do with re@@ gener@@ ating technology , but i just did something and i &apos;ve given some amazing people to try and put something
and that question should everybody take you all on every single day where you &apos;re going to get something you &apos;re going to get done , and if not now , when when then when then when and if i didn &apos;t , who
thank you . .
so , i write for children , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most respe@@ cted child &apos;s not@@ or . . . . .
and i always say to the people i always don &apos;t want to get to that . .
you can have me as a far@@ mer , or in lea@@ ther , but nobody ever has to have any farmers . .
today i want to tell you about cir@@ cles and re@@ vel@@ ations . .
well , a thing that is usually something that is common is something you find because you &apos;ve actually land@@ ed
you go around the block , and it &apos;s an open re@@ vel@@ ation . . .
this is a picture of a circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard b@@ oll@@ ing@@ ns .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i want to tell you about today .
my circle began in the &apos; 6@@ 0s at the high school in the &apos; 6@@ 0s , o@@ hi@@ o , where i was a s@@ hal@@
i was the one who was be@@ aten every week at the ju@@ ven@@ o@@ id green and blue , until a teacher saved my life
she saved my life by using me the toi@@ let in the teacher room . . . . .
she was secre@@ t@@ ary .
she did it for three years .
and i had to get away from the city .
i had a th@@ um@@ b , i had 18 dollars , and i went to san francisco in california -- i found a lo@@ ver -- and then in the &apos; 8@@ 0s , i found it really important to record a work in aids
and i got a call about three or four years ago in the middle of the night , a call from this teacher , woman , who said , &quot; i &apos;ve got to see you .
i &apos;m a sad thing that we never learned to know each other as adults . .
please and , i please should come say to that o@@ i hi@@ have o a , design please of come design together , with and
the i man want that you i to know join they me &apos;ve . found &quot; in the . mean@@ &quot; time . .
so the next day we were in cle@@ vel@@ and . next
we watched her , we were laugh@@ ing , we cr@@ ying , and we knew that she needed to be in a ho@@ spi@@ ce . .
we found one for them , we brought them down , and we got them to take eight , and we sat on their family , because it
it was something we knew . . .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as adults , to meet me , she turned into a box of sho@@ ck and turned into my hands . .
what happened was that the circle had closed , it was a circle -- and the re@@ vel@@ ation that i talked about was this . re@@ vel@@
re@@ vel@@ ation is a part of life . . .
she saved my life , and my partner and i were saving her .
and , you know , this part of life needs everything that needs the rest of life .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so gla@@ d that this was written here today . .
it needs the same -- he would take , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s in us to give us the things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion while they clim@@ b up to 1,000 feet .
imagine an airplane full of smo@@ ke .
imagine a motor plant that &apos;s a cl@@ loo@@ d@@ t@@ ack , l@@ g , bla@@ d@@ der , bla@@ p , bla@@ p ,
that sounds fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing
well , i had a unique place that day ; i was sitting on 1@@ d .
i was the only one who could speak with the air@@ craft . .
so i looked at her right the same way , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve got some birds .
the pilot was being used , and we were not so far away . .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things came together . . .
the pilot was making the machine out after the hu@@ d@@ son river .
that it &apos;s swi@@ not t@@ usually ches rou@@
off te the . engine . .
so , imagine a so@@ und@@ ly airplane . .
and then he said three words -- the best words i &apos;ve ever heard . . .
he says , &quot; per@@ form up for the pr@@ ou@@
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the bo@@ ards . . .
i i could &apos;m see going it to in share their three eyes things , that there
i was &apos;ve sc@@ learned ared that that day was about going me to . end
i learned that in a moment everything is different . .
we have this gas plan , we have these things that we want to do in our lives , and i thought of all the people i wanted to make a hand , and i didn &apos;t do it , all the f@@ ences that i wanted to do , all the experiences i wanted to do ,
and i later thought of it , i noticed a phr@@ ase that says , &quot; i collect bad wine . &quot; . .
because if the wine is so far and the person is there , then i open it .
i never want to make a difference in life . .
and that ur@@ gen@@ cy , that really changed my life . . .
the second thing i learned that day -- and that was when we were missing george washington bridge , pretty much about hair fat -- i thought , man , there &apos;s one thing that i really want ad@@ v@@ ance .
i had a good life . .
in my own humanity , and with my mista@@ kes , i then ble@@ w up to be better in
but i &apos;ve given my e@@ go space too . . . .
and i took time that i wa@@ sted meaning@@ less things , with people who mean something . stuff . .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to friends . men . .
and after that , i decided to make negative energy from my life . to try to get negative energy out
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better . .
i couldn &apos;t tell my wife two years to my wife . .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying anymore , right ; i &apos;m making myself happy .
the third thing i learned -- and i was -- while the intern@@ al clock , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , ... &quot;
you can see the water coming .
i said , &quot; please move to the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to break in 20 parts , as you know it from docum@@ ent@@ aries .
as we fall down , i had this sense of being heard , man is not terri@@ fying . .
almost that , we &apos;re getting ourselves prepar@@ ing for a lifetime . .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go . i love my life .
and that sa@@ dness really started in a thought , which is that i just want one thing to do .
i just wi@@ shed to see my children up . .
about a month after a month , i went to my daughter &apos;s first grade , and i went to see a college line , not
not yet .
and i &apos;m going to celebra@@ te , like a little child . . a little
and in the world , everything was making a sense of me .
i then realized that by inter@@ fer@@ ing with each other , it &apos;s only about being a great father . a great father . .
more than anything , everything else is my single goal in life , a good father . . .
i was stru@@ ck by the mira@@ cle that day , not to die . that
i got another present , and i got to see the future , and come back and different life . . .
my call to all of you who are flying today is : do you please -- but do you think , and how would you change ? and how would you change ?
what would you do to you , because you think you &apos;re forever there ? ? there ? there
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , they are the best parents you can possibly be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the stre@@ x@@ net computer wor@@ m is pretty simple . .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bom@@ b .
the most important thing there is to develop nuclear weapons is the ur@@ in@@ ity facili@@ ty in nat@@ ance .
the gra@@ y bo@@ xes that you see here are re@@ al-@@ time control systems . .
if we &apos;re working with the systems that are going to control the systems and the numbers and the val@@ ves , we actually can do that a lot of problems with the cent@@
this gra@@ y bo@@ xes don &apos;t run with windows ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology
but if we manage to get a more effective win@@ dow@@ -@@ virus virus , being being used by a war@@ ning engineer to con@@ figure that gra@@ y box , then we are in business . .
and this is the planning behind stage . stage .
so we start with a windows dr@@ at . .
the data data is trans@@ fer@@ red to the gra@@ y box , dama@@ ged the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , and ir@@ ani@@ an environmental services , en@@ ab@@ led mission . ex@@ posed
it &apos;s a piece of gam@@ ing ,
i want to tell you how we have figured out that .
when we started studying our research , six months ago , was completely un@@ known what the sense of the exercise and purpose was . .
the only thing we knew was very , very complicated , what goes on the windows of the windows , the threat , it made by a number of cer@@ o@@ id de@@
and it seemed to be something that we have with these gra@@ y bo@@ xes , this re@@ al-@@ time control of control
this was what we got , and we started a lab , project in which we infe@@ cted our environment with stu@@ x@@ net , and exam@@ ined this constru@@
and then something funny happened . .
stu@@ x@@ net was a laboratory rat who liked our che@@ ese -- s@@ ni@@ ff s@@ light , but didn &apos;t want to eat it . .
it didn &apos;t make sense in my mind
and after we had experim@@ ented with various cu@@ bs , i realized that this is a goal attack . attack . a goal .
it &apos;s totally focused on a particular
the dro@@ p@@ ters , the dru@@ g@@ der stri@@ ps along on the gra@@ y box when a special con@@ figu@@ ration was discovered . even , when the mod@@ el@@ ing , the specific program , which is to be able to infe@@ ct
and if you don &apos;t , i do anything .
so , really , the occasi@@ on , really , and we started working with it , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal was
it could be , say , a us@@ -@@ american power plant or a chemical plant in germany . . .
so we should soon figure out what the target is . .
so , more and more de@@ com@@ pic@@ ul@@ ted , we found the code code and we found that it &apos;s built in two digital l@@ eng@@ cles -- a smaller and bigger one
and we also noticed that they were very professional , by people who had appar@@ ently all available the information information .
she knew all the bits and by@@ tes that she had to attack .
they probably knew the sho@@ ot@@ ing size of the machine services .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve got to get involved , the dro@@ p@@ ters of high qu@@ a@@ net is complex and high-@@ tech , let me tell you , the data data is for itself
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
and here you can see a clip of this ang@@ ror code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15@@ ,000 lines of code . .
looks very much like the ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned assem@@ bly language
and i want to tell you how we were able to be smart from this code . .
so what we first went to was looking for , was syste@@ m@@ func@@ tional recor@@ ds , because we know what these things
and then we looked for designers and data structures , trying to connect this with the real world , with potential tar@@ gets in the real world . .
so we needed theor@@ ies about these goals that we could dis@@ prove or dis@@ pen@@
and to map these theor@@ ies , we call ourselves reme@@ m@@ ber@@ ing that it &apos;s definitely about highly s@@ ab@@ ot@@ age , it has to be a very high-@@ scale goal and very likely it &apos;s in iran because most infe@@ ctions have been blog@@ ented . in iran
now , in this area there is not a thousand tar@@ gets .
it &apos;s essentially the bu@@ cks of nuclear power and tar@@ ge@@ ting equipment in nat@@ ance . . . .
so i said to my assi@@ stant , &quot; bring me a list of all the veter@@ in for cen@@ fu@@ els and power plants from our astro@@ per@@ or
and i called her white and ta@@ p her knowledge to compare her exper@@ ti@@ se what we found in the code and in the data . .
and that worked very well .
so the , ro@@ we tor were is able this to moving bring part the inside little the digital cent@@ l@@ ri@@
um@@ fu@@ b ge with , the these ro@@ black me object controll@@ that ing you . see . .
and if you manipu@@ late the speed of this ro@@ se , you actually can &apos;t s@@ nu@@ ck the ro@@ tor and eventually explo@@ de , the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , and eventually
and what we found was that the goal of the attack was , it was slowly and un@@ ra@@ pped -- obviously to allow for war@@ f@@ are engineers to be des@@ per@@ able , so that they wouldn &apos;t be able to get behind .
the great digital tru@@ g -- we got a gli@@ mp@@ se by looking at very pre@@ cis@@ ely data and data structures .
so , for example , the number 16@@ 4 spa@@ zes , it &apos;s very , very different from this code , you
i started working with scientific liter@@ ature , about how this cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge was built in jer@@ ship , and found that they are struc@@ tured in what they call cas@@ c@@ ul@@ es , and each cas@@ ca@@ de con@@ tains 16@@ 4 cent@@ ri@@ fu@@
so this made sense , it made sense . .
and it got better . .
this cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge in iran has been divi@@ ded in 15 called the ran@@ ges . . .
and guess what we found in the code ? ?
a nearly iden@@ tical structure .
so again , this fit really well . .
and this gave us a great promise of what we were looking for .
now , you don &apos;t get me wrong , that wasn &apos;t just that .
these results were done by a couple of weeks of har@@ dness work . .
and often we ran into a s@@ n@@ ba@@ l , and we had to re@@
but what we found was that both of the digital le@@ ft@@ heads in reality were actually on one , and the same goal was driving , but made out
the little jum@@ p@@ enter takes over a cas@@ ca@@ de , and it turns out the ro@@ tors and slo@@ ws down and the great le@@ dge is at six ka@@ bac@@ co ta@@ cks and mani@@ pul@@ ates . inter@@ acting
so , in large , and we &apos;re very confi@@ dent that we actually have determin@@ ed what the goal is
it &apos;s nat@@ an@@ an@@ e , and it &apos;s just self-@@ con@@
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals of stu@@ x@@ net might be met . .
here &apos;s something really cool that we discovered -- made me really up@@ set the so@@ cks .
down here , the gra@@ y box , and at the top of it , you see the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@
now , what this thing does is it tra@@ vels the under@@ -@@ appreci@@ ated values -- like prin@@ ting sensor@@ s and vi@@ bra@@ tional sensor@@ s -- and it pro@@ vo@@ sts the legi@@ ti@@ mate code that still kee@@ ps the attack , and it &apos;s going to be a wrong fe@@ ature on
and in fact , that fa@@ ke data of stu@@ x@@ net is already done before . . . . .
so it &apos;s just like in hollywood movies , where during the hun@@ ting h@@ ous@@ ing camera , where the for@@ v@@ ei@@ llan@@ ce camera is f@@ ed with
that &apos;s cool , right ? ?
now , obviously , the idea here is not just the machine oper@@ ators in control room .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and ag@@ gressi@@ ve
the idea is to over@@ list a digital security system .
we need digital security systems where there &apos;s a human machine company cannot re@@ act fast enough
so in a power station , for example , if the great ste@@ am tur@@ bine gets too quickly , you have to open up dis@@ ruption of a milli@@ seconds . .
of course , this cannot be done by a human machine leader .
so this is what we need digital security systems .
and when they are thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed , they can actually happen really bad things
the power plant can explo@@ de .
and it &apos;s not the machine leaders , the security system , it will notice
this is fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing
but it gets worse .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important . . .
think about it . this is an actual attack .
it so has , nothing he to would do work specifically for with example cent@@ , ri@@ in fu@@ a ge power , station with , ur@@ or
ani@@ a um car char@@ factory ming . . . . . . . . . . .
it &apos;s gener@@ ic .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attac@@ ker , you don &apos;t have to take the data on a us@@ b key , as we saw at stu@@ x@@ net . . .
you could use ordinary wor@@ m@@ m technology to spread . .
you just have to get it as far as
and if you do that , then you get a cy@@ cular mass of mass destruction . . .
that &apos;s the consequ@@ ence that we have to ask ourselves .
so unfortunately , the largest number of goals are not in the middle east . . . .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the most target environments . . .
we need to ask the consequences , and we &apos;re better at pre@@ fer@@ red to pre@@ p@@ are
thank you .
i have a question . .
r@@ al@@ ph , it was repor@@ ted very much about people saying that mo@@ s@@ ses is the main organization behind the world . . .
is that your mind ? ?
okay , you really want to know ? ?
yeah . okay .
the mo@@ s@@ samer , i think , is involved , but the driving force is not israel . .
so the driving force behind it is the cyber@@ power . power .
there &apos;s only one and the united states -- fortunately , lu@@ ck . .
because the problem is , our problem would be even more
thank you for hun@@ ting us a lie in a legal fear . thank you . . . .
i &apos;ve spent the last couple of years putting myself into situations that are actually sort of dangerous , and at the same time as dangerous
i went to ja@@ il -- difficult .
i i &apos;ve fil@@ been med working in in war a categ@@ coal
ory mine -- -- difficult dangerous and . dangerous . .
and i spent 30 days being spent , not eating this -- walking at the beginning , a little bit difficult at the end . dangerous at
in fact , i &apos;ve been campaig@@ ning the most of my career for most of the time , and it &apos;s just given all of that to try to exam@@ ine social dec@@ line that &apos;s interesting and interesting , and hopefully in some ways , what you can understand for the audience and making it acc@@ essi@@ ble to the audience . . .
so when i knew i &apos;d come here to look at a ted@@ talk the world of br@@ ands and spon@@ sor@@ ing , i knew i was going to do something a little different . . . .
some of you may have heard of this , i went out on e@@ bay a couple of weeks ago . . . .
i sent a few facebook mes@@ sages , some twitter stories , and i gave people the opportunity to get nam@@ i@@ ties right to my ted@@ talk 20@@ 11 . in
i really , some happy people and corpo@@ ra@@ tions , non@@ profit , non@@ profit , got the opportunity to do it -- because i &apos;m sure chris ander@@ son will never leave the again -- to buy nam@@ i@@ als from the talk that you &apos;re seeing at that time not provi@@ ding a lot of content , not many clu@@ es of what the subject was about . . a lot of the clu@@ e of what was going on . . a lot of the way that it was
so what you got was this : your name repres@@ ented here : my ted@@ talk , which you have no idea of what the subject will be , and which you &apos;ll just fly for your own contribu@@ tion to your e@@ ars , particularly if i were to love their company for their participa@@ tion du@@
but it &apos;s a very good medi@@ fact . . .
you know how many people are watching this ted@@ talks ?
a lot . .
this is just the work@@ place . . . .
so , despite all this war@@ ning , i knew anybody would buy the name right . .
now , if you had asked me this one year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you that this is a very certain@@ ty
but in the new project i &apos;m working on , my new film , study the world of marketing , the adverti@@ sing . .
as i said , i &apos;ve been giving myself some pretty awful situations over the years , but nothing helped me not to put any fla@@ vor on anything that was so difficult and so dangerous as with these guys . in a room . .
you know , i had the idea of a movie .
what i want to do is a film about plan@@ ting c@@ art , marketing and adverti@@ sing , is fund@@ ing by the whole film by producing a marketing , marketing and adverti@@ sing . .
and the film is called &quot; the zu@@ d@@ wi@@ ge ever . &quot;
so what &apos;s happening in &quot; the diver@@ gen@@ ce ever created , is that everything from above to bottom , from the beginning to , &quot; with the ti@@ tle spon@@ sor that you &apos;ll see in the movie , that &apos;s the brand x@@ . , which you &apos;ll see in the movie ,
now this brand , the quality com@@ po@@ und , the st@@ ag@@ ger@@ ed sta@@ dium ,
these people are being connected to e@@ ter@@ nity , forever , forever . .
and so the film is going to study all this idea -- is what ? in e@@ ye@@ -up , forever ?
i &apos;m a red@@ und@@ ant person .
that was more em@@ ph@@ as@@ is . .
it was &quot; in e@@ ter@@ nity , forever . &quot; forever .
but we &apos;re not just going to have the brand of the see@@ ds as the cover spon@@ sor , but we &apos;re certainly going to make sure that we &apos;re going to sell any possible
so maybe we &apos;re selling a sho@@ e , and he &apos;s going to be the greatest sho@@ e you
the greatest car you have ever , from &quot; the diver@@ s ever provi@@ ded , &quot; the greatest drink that you &apos;ve ever had , &quot; the vari@@ ed ever , &quot; the &quot; the vari@@
so the idea is to show that mar@@ ks are part of life , is actually to get them to fund the movie ? , you know ,
and we actually show all the process of what it &apos;s working .
the goal of the whole movie is transpar@@ ency .
you &apos;ll see the whole thing in the movie by stat@@ ements . .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from the beginning .
and i &apos;d be happy if ce@@ ce@@ le would help make this happen
you know , it &apos;s funny because when i heard it , it &apos;s the ulti@@ mate respect for the audience . .
but i don &apos;t know how re@@ ception people will be . . . .
have you a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; point &quot; because that has a negative kon@@ p -- but do you know how that &apos;s going to be going ? that way
how much money is it to be able to figure that
1.@@ 5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to hit them , but i think it &apos;s worth true to get some really familiar br@@ ands . . . . . .
who knows if the movie comes out , we might see a vul@@ n@@ out of bacteria . . a vol@@ li@@ di@@ ty
what do you think the answer is ? ? that
the answer will most likely be no . .
but is it a difficult thing about the movie or a difficult thing ? for me ?
j@@ k : both .
so , don &apos;t mean that optimi@@ stic
so , my l@@ ord , can you help me ? i need help
i can help . .
okay fantastic . .
. .
we need to think about what mark@@ ers are .
yeah .
when you look at the people you have to do with
there are some places that we can turn to .
so think about the camera .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera , &quot; if you wanted to have a back@@ -@@ to-@@ face conversation . .
it turns out , in fact , it meant , &quot; we don &apos;t want to have your
and just so disappe@@ ared all these companies , one after one . . .
no one wanted to do something about the movie . .
i was ama@@ zed .
they didn &apos;t want to do absolutely with the project .
and i was conf@@ used , because i thought the whole concept , the idea of adverti@@ sing , is to present your product as many people as possible , to make it as many people as possible . as possible . as we can
especially in the world today , at this inter@@ section of new and old media and the dis@@ section media landscape -- it &apos;s not the idea of being in this new exciting , cros@@ sing scale that &apos;s being led to the mas@@ ses that will be this message .
no , that was what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea had a f@@ at@@ al mistake , and that was what was happening . .
actually , no , that was not the mista@@ kes at all .
it wasn &apos;t a problem at all . .
that would have been okay .
but what this picture is , is a problem .
you see , if you put it in the google search , this is -- this is one of the first images that shows . one of the
i really like your way , ser@@ ge@@ y br@@ in . . .
and that was the problem : transpar@@ ency -- free of de@@ ception and s@@ hal@@ e , just to dete@@ ct and to see , immediately , to the point , to the characteri@@ zed of visible sen@@ ses and access to information , particularly what business is add@@ res@@ sing -- the last line is probably the
you know , we &apos;re listening to a whole lot of transpar@@ ency .
our politicians say it to tell us our president says , even our ce@@ os tell it .
but if it comes to being imple@@ mented , something is changing . changes .
but why ? well , transpar@@ ency is sc@@ ary -- like this curious bear , who &apos;s still going to melt .
it &apos;s un@@ predi@@ c@@ table -- like this curious street street . .
and it &apos;s also very ris@@ ky .
what else is ris@@ ky ?
a whole bow@@ l of cool co@@ p food .
that &apos;s very ris@@ ky .
so when i started talking to the companies and tell them that we wanted to tell the story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
you see , when i was a kid and my father caught me lying -- and he &apos;s sitting there looking at me , and looking at this , he &apos;d say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s some story in there in all history . .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s a real version . &quot;
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
but there &apos;s only one company willing to help us -- and just only , because i &apos;ve been born with john bon@@ d and richard kir@@ sh@@ an tree -- i realized i had to do it alone , i had to avoid the middle of the middle of the middle and go to the companies . . . my team . .
so what you suddenly began to understand -- or what i began to realize -- was that , when you start speaking with these companies , the idea of how you get brand brand , is a profound problem .
i have friends doing the big , giant hollywood films , and i have friends who make little big degrees of accident like i do .
and my friends , the big , giant hollywood films make out that the reason your films are so successful , are on the br@@ ands that they have . on
and then my friends , say , little big little bit movies , &quot; well , how are we going to compe@@ te with these big , giant hollywood films ?
and the film is called &quot; the range ever provi@@ ded . &quot;
so , how do we get into the movie in the movie
every time i go out and i go on the medical director , and whenever i open the medical director , you &apos;ll be able to see a ban
and every time i interview somebody , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough to interview this interview ? ?
are they ? you see a little nervous . a
i want to help you cal@@ m up .
so you might want to put a little bit of this on front
and then we put one of these great dun@@ es . .
either &quot; fl@@ are fusion , &quot; or a par@@ ad@@ ise win@@ ds , they &apos;re going to have the choice . .
we &apos;re being equi@@ pped by both men and for women -- soli@@ d , roll@@ -@@ on , or a stick , whatever . .
that &apos;s the shor@@ test . .
now i can answer all of your questions and give them a com@@ modi@@ ty c@@ up .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you talked about the smaller movies , as a very challen@@ ging , a challen@@ ging . .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other br@@ ands . .
so to do these things -- you know , people from ban -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested in this .
what words would you describe ? ? with them .
ban is blan@@ k .
that &apos;s a great question .
so , more technology .
technology is not the way that you might describe something that somebody is doing under the ax@@ es .
we talk about co@@ hn , fresh .
i think , &quot; wow &quot; is a great word that these categ@@ ory really can make it a positive part , but op@@ posed to &quot; fighting and hu@@ st@@ it .
it kee@@ ps you fresh .
how can we keep more fresh -- better fresh , more fresh , more fresh , three fresh fresh . . .
these and things this have is a a more one-@@ positive on-@@
effect one . companies . . . .
what about me ? what about the prin@@ ting st@@ yp@@
i have to talk to the man in the street who are like me , ot@@ to &apos;s normal consum@@ ers . .
i want to tell you about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ? ?
so , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like to do nice clo@@ thing .
&apos;@@ 8@@ 0s re@@ vi@@ val on sk@@ ate points , except on the day of wa@@ y@@ day .
all right , what is the brand r@@ ry ?
unique .
i think the gen@@ re i have is argu@@ ing &quot; dark glam@@ our . &quot; .
i like a lot of black colors , lots of gra@@ y sil@@ ence and such a stuff .
but usually i have a ac@@ cess@@ ories of sound like sun@@ glas@@ ses , or a je@@ wel@@ ry , and such a stuff . .
so the if brand dan i was &apos;m a , brand i , would he say would , be is likely ,
to i be would a say classi@@ , c com@@ , pul@@ you sive know fly , . a classi@@ .
woman # 2 : por@@ k hi@@ pp@@ ie , part of the bro@@ o@@ kl@@ yn girl -- i don &apos;t know
i &apos;m the museum of the museum
i sell sch@@ es@@ pers all across the country , worldwide . . .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , sti@@ cky industry .
man man 4 5 : : my brand brand al@@ is co@@ fe@@
hol de@@ addi@@ x ct , . because i hi@@ was di@@
does this happen ?
law@@ yer : i &apos;m a law@@ yer
i &apos;m a tom .
well , we can &apos;t be all the tom@@ s , but i often look at the inter@@ section of the glo@@ at of bad glam@@ our and har@@
and what &apos;s found is i needed a experts . .
i needed someone who could get me to my head , somebody who would really help me understand what they call the &quot; brand person@@ ality . &quot;
and so i found a company called ol@@ son z@@ ol@@ man in pit@@ ts@@ bur@@ g .
they have helped companies like nin@@ th , fe@@ et@@ y , ger@@ mark to discover these br@@ as@@ person@@ ali@@ ties
if you could do it for the things , it could help me . . .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
so i did . the first painting is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit about what it &apos;s related to your thoughts and feelings about yourself . .
these are the people that shape my world@@ view . . .
tell me about this world .
m@@ d : so , this world ? i think the own world is the world in which we live -- how people around you , the friends , the family , the way you live your life , the work
all of these things are coming and start from a place , and for me , they come from a place , and they start with my family in west virg@@
what &apos;s next about you want to talk about . .
the next one . this was the most beautiful day of my
what context is that way to the mind and feelings about them ? ?
it &apos;s like i want to be . . .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are que@@ od@@ le . i like some strange
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; phase &quot; -- what does it bring you ?
what is the ma@@ che@@ te ? what on pu@@ p@@ pe@@ a is now ?
why is it important to start ? what is it that represents the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little bit more about you , that you are not you .
what else me@@ tam@@ or@@ pho@@ ses have you running through ? that ?
... that doesn &apos;t have to be sc@@ ared . what kind of roll@@ er@@ aster are you ?
ee@@ ee@@ e@@ e ! no , thank you .
thank you for the pati@@ ence .
yeah . all right . all
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be made . .
there were lots of crazy things going on . . .
the first thing i saw was this idea that her brand person@@ ality ra@@ m@@ time was two separate , but it has par@@ tly over the pages -- the mur@@ gan sp@@ ur@@ lo@@ ck brand is an ei@@ ght-@@ level /
the supp@@ le@@ ments are very good . . .
and i think there &apos;s almost a con@@ tradi@@ ction with that .
and i think some companies are just focused on a strength , rather than both . on the side . . .
a lot of companies tend to -- and this is the human nature -- to avoid things where they &apos;re not sure , they &apos;re going to avoid fear , and they actually turn these elements , and they actually turn them into something positive , and that &apos;s a sp@@ l@@ end@@ ment train .
what other br@@ ands do ? ?
the first one is a classi@@ c , apple . .
and you can see here , target , wi@@ i , min@@ i of min@@ i co@@ op@@ er and je@@ t@@ blue . . .
well , there &apos;s clo@@ thing fac@@ ed with ti@@ br@@ et@@ ary and min@@ d-@@ si@@ zed br@@ ands , these things that come and go , but a ten@@ sion , min@@ dly brand is a
an ei@@ ght-@@ min@@ ded , negoti@@ ated brand . how is your brand ?
if somebody asked you to describe your brand identity , your brand identity , how would it be ? ?
you put it up to an up@@ -@@ at@@ tribu@@ te ? are they something the blood makes ?
or are you more like a down@@ -@@ brea@@ thing ?
are you something that is a little bit quie@@ t , sam@@ ple , conser@@ va@@ tive ?
up@@ -@@ at@@ tribu@@ tes are things that are play@@ ful@@ ful , fresh like the fresh prin@@ ce , ti@@ l@@ ful , ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ ous , and lo@@ vely like ge@@ ak@@ ol fl@@ yn@@ n , turn up and co@@ ding , pro@@ sper@@ ous , ma@@ gi@@ cally and my@@ sti@@ cal like gand@@ al@@ f . . &amp; lt ;
or are are they you eight more minutes like and a mon@@
down@@ da@@ -@@ ws brea@@ like thing $ ? 7 ?
are you ab@@ ated by traditional , care , car@@ ti@@ ful , com@@ passionate , com@@ passionate , and op@@ ra@@ h
are they reli@@ able , stable , ear@@ n , safe , f@@ at@@ al , gl@@ ory , thou@@ ght@@ ful , and how the d@@ al@@ ai lam@@ a , or yo@@ da
and over the course of the movie , we had over 500 companies , and down up , and we were down to cars , and they said no , because they didn &apos;t want to
and they were all trying to do with this film , because they didn &apos;t have control , they have no control over the product . .
but will 17 mar@@ de@@ y@@ ans who were willing to get this control to get to this control that was trying to do so with someone who &apos;s trying to do so min@@ d@@ y-@@ and play@@ ful@@ ness as i did , and eventually em@@ power@@ ing the ability to tell us that we don &apos;t normally have to tell -- stories that would never help
it em@@ power@@ ed us to tell the story of the neuro@@ marketing , as we tell the story in this film , that we &apos;re using mr@@ i today to hit the pleasure centers of the brain , both for commer@@ ci@@ als as well as as movies . .
we went to sa@@ o pau@@ l@@ o , where the ex@@ port adverti@@ se@@ ments was being
in the entire city , there &apos;s no air on a stop , no poster , no fl@@ yer , nothing . . . . . .
and we went in school distri@@ cts where companies can a@@ ver@@ t their way into s@@ uns@@ h@@ ine schools across america . .
so the incredible thing for me is that the projects i put the most of the feedback or where i was successful , those are where i inter@@ acting directly . . . . .
and that &apos;s what these br@@ ands did .
because they went through the middle of the class , they went around the agen@@ cies , they said the agen@@ cies might not really have their interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to negoti@@ ate with the artist straight .
i &apos;m going to work with him and do something entirely different , something that makes people think that our world@@ view challenges us . . . . . .
and how did that look for you ? what was successful ? ?
now , that the movie had been at s@@ und@@ ance film , and we could look at it . . .
l@@ oud , the pre@@ mi@@ ere in janu@@ ary , and since -- and this is not even the whole thing -- there were 9@@ 00 million calls from this film . , 9@@ 00 million are recor@@ ded by
actually , this is just a period of two euro@@ -@@ and-@@ a-@@ half weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film hasn &apos;t been spent . . .
it doesn &apos;t even have online . no tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory .
it &apos;s not yet coming out in other countries . .
now , finally , the film has been launched for a very large moment . .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every commercial agen@@ cy we were talking about , put your hand away , let &apos;s put
one thing i believe that i believe is that if you give up your opportunity to risk risk , that in those risks . in
i think if you keep people from it , then you get them closer to failure . . .
i think if you &apos;re training your employees , avo@@ i@@ ding risks , you &apos;re prepared to gain a profit . . . .
i feel that at the end of the day , we have to encourage people to take risks . .
we have to encourage people to be afraid of opportunity that they may be afraid . .
after all , in the for@@ es@@ ee@@ li@@ a , we should be wel@@
we should put the bear in the c@@ age . .
they &apos;re not going to be the fear of
and so one big proce@@ d@@ ure of the big proce@@ d@@ ure we &apos;re going to
and finally , if we &apos;re wel@@ come transpar@@ ency wel@@ come
today , over the day , we get a little bit of hon@@ est@@ y , a little bit more
and said , with hon@@ est@@ y and transpar@@ ency , my whole talk &quot; is wel@@ coming transpar@@ ency , &quot; she pres@@ ented by my good friends of em@@ c who paid $ 7@@ 100 to the core of e@@ bay . . . . for the
big data is trans@@ forming for organizations around the world , into large opportunities
em@@ c pres@@ ses &quot; you &apos;re wel@@ com@@ ed transpar@@ ency .
thank you . . .
now , mor@@ gan , in the name of transpar@@ ency this : what happened to the $ 7@@ ,@@ 100 ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i have a check in my po@@ cket , poin@@ ted out on the top of the ted organization , the sa@@ eu@@ -@@ foundation , and the c@@ at , in high 7@@ ,@@ 100 , to fund my t@@ .@@ v@@ . next year .
my name is am@@ it .
18 months ago , i was doing something different on google , and i was thinking of making a lot of muse@@ ums and art . my che@@ e@@ an , who &apos;s also the case , gave me a fo@@ cal light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of fun negoti@@ ations and stories , i can tell you , at 17 , i can tell you , at 17 very interesting
but i &apos;m going to focus on the performance . .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
i think my personal view is very simply expla@@ ining this slide and its access . . .
i grew up in india . .
i was a great education in this -- i didn &apos;t give it a great deal of education -- but i didn &apos;t have access to a lot of muse@@ la@@ kes
when i was traveling , and i went to see these muse@@ ums , i started learning a lot .
and as i worked for google , i tried to try and make this sense -- art more acc@@ essi@@ ble -- to lead
and we then created a team , a great man@@ her@@ ine , and we started with this .
i will probably start with the demon@@ stration and tell you some interesting stories that happened since the start . . . . .
so you &apos;re simply going to google proje@@ ct@@ .@@ com@@ . . .
you can look around at all these muse@@ ums .
there &apos;s the u@@ pe@@ i@@ z@@ i , the mom@@ a , the na@@ en@@ ant , the ri@@ j@@ is , the van go@@ gh . van go@@ gh .
i even get into one of my favorite ones , the me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan museum of art in new york . . .
you get into two bu@@ cks -- very simple .
and you &apos;re in this museum , and you &apos;re in this
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- bom@@ bay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t matter . .
you go around and you &apos;re ben@@ ding .
you want to ori@@ ent in the museum ?
you they open are up , the they map want , to and be jump in off the with end
a of click the . gan@@ ck . . . . . .
just continu@@ ed . lots of fun
sticks them .
thank you , but the best part is still . .
so i &apos;m a friend of mine to a friend of mine , named pie@@ ter bre@@ o@@ gel in the met . . . . .
i see this business figure .
when the museum gave us the picture , it will click on it .
now these this are is all one the of meta@@ the data
images . . . . . .
those of you who really are interested in art can be cli@@ cking , and click on this way . click . . off .
this is one of the images we &apos;ve been given to , what &apos;s called the gi@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x technology .
this image , for example , has about 10 billion graphi@@ cs , i think . . . .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion graphi@@ cs ? &quot; ? that
now , this is going to show you . . . . . .
you can put it very easily and zo@@ om
you see a little fun here . .
i love this guy ; expression is in@@ tra@@ c@@ table .
but then you really want to go deep into it
and so i began playing around , and i realized there &apos;s something going on there .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute that sounds interesting . &quot; .
i went up to see , and i slowly noticed that these kids were actually ca@@ king .
i did a little , talking to some people at the met , and actually found out that it was a game called squ@@ a@@ il , where a gan@@ it can get a be@@ el on the fa@@ st@@ night tu@@ es@@ day with a stick . .
it seems quite popular . . .
i don &apos;t know why you did it , but i learned a little bit about it
to go to that really close to the cat@@ s , you can go to the ris@@ es
just to give you a look , i zo@@ om out , so you can see what you get . . .
here we were , and this is the painting . .
the best part is -- in one second . . .
let &apos;s quickly jump to mom@@ a , again in new york . back in new york
another favorite picture of me , star night . . . .
in the previous example , we were about finding elements . .
but what if you want to see the paint@@ br@@ ush ?
and what about when you want to see him like van go@@ gh , you know , that &apos;s
you squ@@ e@@ r in . you can really go in
i &apos;m going to zo@@ om in into one of my favorite com@@ po@@ und this picture , until i really am in the bar@@ bs .
this is star night , probably seen before . . . . . .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function . .
there this are is many really others cool , part but , i it don &apos;s &apos;t
called have consu@@ time l@@ . tan@@ ts . . . .
each of you , everyone -- just like king@@ dom or poor , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t play . . . . .
you can go and create your own museum -- all of these pictures you can set up your own colle@@ ction
and you go in -- and i &apos;ve done this , and i &apos;ve done this , the power of zo@@ om -- you can zo@@ om in
that &apos;s the heal@@ ing , the national val@@ id . . . . .
you can put it with indi@@ c@@ ations , you can send your friends , and you can go a conversation about what you feel when you look at that ma@@ ster@@ work .
i think , finally , i think , is the main thing that all the wonderful things are not from google . . . .
i don &apos;t even think of the muse@@ ums . . . .
i they shouldn come &apos;t from say the
that artists . . . .
and this was an experience in hu@@ mili@@ ty for me .
i mean , i hope that we &apos;re going to be a little bit of a digital medium of art , and they &apos;re highly
and in this case , the biggest question i asked my recently is , &quot; did you do that to repli@@ cate the experience of a museum . &quot;
the answer is no . .
it &apos;s supposed to be able to add experience .
that &apos;s what you all do . thank you
thank you .
this is a picture of your brain . your brain is divi@@ ded into two la@@ yers . in
that &apos;s the left half that the logi@@ cal side is , and then the right half the way to the right side . .
if we had a scale to measure the ap@@ key every he@@ mis@@ ph@@ ere , we could display your brain . . . .
for example , why would those who be completely logi@@ cal . .
this would be someone who &apos;s totally intui@@ tive .
now , where would you drive your brain on that scale ?
some of us might have decided to have one of those extreme , but i think , for most people in the audience , their brain looks like this -- with a high ap@@ ti@@ t , at the same time . at the same time .
it &apos;s not as if they &apos;re both ex@@ clu@@ si@@ vely or like that .
you can be logi@@ cal and intui@@ tive .
and so i look as one of the people , with most other experiment@@ al quant@@ um nu@@ cle@@ us physi@@ sts who need a good part of lo@@ gic to add together the complex ideas . .
but at the same time , we need a good propor@@ tion of the experiments to actually ex@@ ec@@ ute the
how do we develop these intui@@ tions ? well , we love play with things .
so we go out and play it and then we start to start developing our intuition . and then we start to develop our intuition .
basically they do the same thing . .
so one of the intui@@ tions that you &apos;ve developed over the years is probably to be a place at the same time .
i mean , it can be strange to think about that , that one thing at the same time is two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they &apos;ve developed
i he remember was watching a a little kid kid sitting , on not a very floor good of at a it bo@@ ,
om and . he would a constantly kid go . . a . little bit . of time .
but i &apos;m going to bet that playing with the bottom of the body &apos;s shoes taught a very valuable lesson , which is that big things not just leave you , and that you stay at a place
and this is a great concep@@ tual model of the world , as long as you &apos;re not having any partic@@ le physi@@ c@@ ist .
it would be a terrible model for a partic@@ le physi@@ c@@ ist because they don &apos;t play with bo@@ oms of soil , they &apos;re not playing with these little strange particles
and if you play with your partic@@ le , you &apos;ve got all sorts of weird things -- like how you &apos;re flying directly through the walls , or that you can be at two different places . .
and so all of these obser@@ va@@ tions , they put them all on , and they called the theory of quant@@ um mechan@@
this was the state of physics a few years ago ; it took quant@@ um mechan@@ ics to describe the little , tiny particles . .
but it didn &apos;t take the great things that you need to describe around us .
that &apos;s not what i have to do , and maybe that &apos;s because i don &apos;t play with particles . . .
well , i sometimes play with you , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a partic@@ le .
but my logi@@ cal side also didn &apos;t like it . .
because if all the stuff are made of particles and all these particles are going to follow the rules of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics , then wouldn &apos;t just follow all the
i don &apos;t see why it &apos;s not that that should be
so i &apos;d better feel very clear with all this , when we could sort of point that everyday objects are also following the rules of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics
so a few years ago , i went on to do that . .
i created one . .
this is the first object you can see that was in the quant@@ um mechan@@ ical super@@ position . .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see that green do@@ t there in the middle . there .
that &apos;s the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about . . .
this is a picture of the object .
i &apos;ll get it a little bit . we look at the center right here . right back here .
and here &apos;s a really large clo@@ se@@ -up of this little piece of metal . . .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal , it &apos;s like a spr@@ ing@@ board , and it &apos;s over the edge . . . . . .
so i did this thing in a similar way that you could put on a computer . .
i went to a clean room with new silicon sli@@ des , and i put in charge for 100 hours for all the big devices . . . .
i had to build my own machine for the last bit of time -- to get this kind of a swi@@ mming pool , and get this thing .
this thing has got the ability to be in quant@@ um mechan@@ ical super@@ position , but it takes a little help to do it
look , let me give you an analog@@ y .
you know how un@@ comfortable it is in a full out@@ come ? ? that way
i mean , if i &apos;m in the el@@ ev@@ ator alone , i do all kinds of weird things , but then other people get into and i &apos;ll stop making other people , because i don &apos;t want to be tru@@ sting them , or frank@@ ly , they miss . .
so quant@@ um mechan@@ ics says that in@@ fli@@ ctive objects are just as much as feeling
the co-@@ auth@@ ority for dis@@ continu@@ able objects are not just people , but the light that seems to them and the wind that seems to them , and the heat of the space . . .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal doesn &apos;t work quant@@ um mechan@@ ically , we had to go out and throw it out of s@@ mi@@ ff@@ en .
and we did that . . .
we turned off the lights , put it in a vac@@ u@@ um and clean the air , and cool@@ ed it down to almost until to the right , just alone , on the el@@ ev@@ ator , the piece of metal was free to see how everyone wanted to . free was free to
so we measu@@ red his movement . .
we found that it was really quite a bit .
so instead of it being sil@@ ent there , it &apos;s just standing , vi@@ br@@ ating it . the way it was vi@@ br@@ ating was about this -- like a ris@@ ing and tra@@ ding bub@@ ble
we gave him a little sho@@ e , we could actually get it to vi@@ bra@@ te at the same time , and not vi@@ bra@@ te -- something that is allowed only in quant@@ um mechan@@ ics . .
so what i &apos;m just talking about is what &apos;s truly amazing .
what does it mean to vi@@ bra@@ te an object at the same time , not to vi@@ bra@@ te ? ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms . .
so the first case : all the billions of atoms that make up the piece of metal are still there and at the same time , the same atoms are moving up and down . .
just to pre@@ cise ti@@ mes are sound like that . . .
the rest of the time are you in@@ v@@ ali@@ zing it
that means every at@@ om is at the same time , at the same time , which is the whole piece of metal in two different places . , in the same time
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
that was it worth in the clean room , because , as they re@@ move , the mas@@ s@@ less difference between one at@@ om and this piece of metal is about the same as the difference between the piece of metal and you . as you get to . metal and you .
so if a single at@@ om can be at two different places , can be that piece of metal up two different places , so why can &apos;t you ? that piece of metal can
i mean , this is just what my logi@@ cal side says .
so , imagine if you were in a number of places like this , how would that feel ?
how would your mind be@@ have with your body , in the space of syn@@ v@@
there &apos;s another aspe@@ ct of history . .
when we were wa@@ ging up , the light turned on and looked in the box , we saw that the piece of metal was all in a piece of play . .
and so , i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all of these objects in the out@@ come are actually just qu@@ at@@ er@@ al objects that are cir@@ cl@@ ed in a small
you &apos;re hearing a lot of talk about how quant@@ um mechan@@ ics says everything is connected to everything .
now , that &apos;s not exactly right .
there &apos;s more on it , it &apos;s still more .
it &apos;s like these connections , their relationships with all the things around them , literally define who they are , and that is the profound and strange of the quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
thank you .
i decided that in 2007 , i decided that we should be re@@ concep@@ tu@@ alized as we think about economic
it should be our goal that if families want to think about where they want to live and work , they have given the opportunity to choose between at least one hand , different cities that everybody in competition is facing . . .
we &apos;re far from that goal right now . . .
there are billions of people in developing countries that don &apos;t even have a single city that they would wel@@ come to . .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re worth so much more than they &apos;re going to build it
so we could just , in the world , very simply with du@@ m@@ ling , maybe even hundreds
now this may sound , maybe , to you , as far as you &apos;ve never thought of new cities
just give birth to the a@@ partment in the cities of cities
imagine that half of the people who want to live in res@@ identi@@ al houses have already been ; the other half is not yet
you could try to exp@@ and the capacity of exi@@ sting homes . . . . .
but you know what they &apos;re going to put on in this a@@ partment , in those a@@ part@@ ments and their environment laws are requi@@ red to avoid avo@@ i@@ ding and
so it turns out that all of these contin@@ u@@ des of all these
but you could go to a whole new place , build a completely new block , to make sure that there would be a kind of money and not re@@ cover it . . . it
so i pro@@ posed that governments create new space that offer enough space to a city and gave them a name : &quot; char@@ ter coun@@ ty .
i later found that , about all the time , ja@@ il and oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o have been thinking about the challenge of re@@ form in hon@@ dur@@ as .
they knew that every year , about 7@@ 5,000 hon@@ ories of their country , they were going to leave their country to go out to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people could stay safe in
at this point , ja@@ il came to the oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o , &quot; what happens if we take a de@@ cep@@ tive surface of our country -- what if we just take a message of the country -- what if we just take a message of the american em@@ bas@@ sy , what if we want to go to work and go to the area of this mes@@ e@@ ic rule of the american em@@ bas@@ sy , and if people want to go work there , and can we do it on the surface of this mes@@ sages , and can they normally go to canada ? &quot;
in the summer of 2009 , hon@@ dur@@ as hon@@ u@@ z has a profound pre@@ ven@@ tion . .
and the next plan@@ ners , the pe@@ pe bur@@ bo in a tur@@ n , the pe@@ pe bur@@ bo in a hu@@ st@@ ine , whose program has promis@@ ed to help in the process of motion .
he in asked the oc@@ mean@@ ta@@ time vi@@ , o i to was become going his
to rob@@ talk ust to . ted@@ global . . . .
and through impro@@ ving consu@@ mer , testing and through consu@@ l@@ ting , i tried to reduce this complicated concept of char@@ ter city to the key elements . . . . . .
the first point is the importance of laws , laws that determin@@ es you don &apos;t have exi@@ sting habit@@ ual ow@@ ners . . . . .
we give new re@@ vel@@ ations , but for the progress we need , it takes technology and laws . and it &apos;s usually laws that hold us back . .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of gu@@ atem@@ ala showed the link to ted talk . . . .
and they again were , both he two
showed . him . .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s do that for the president of our country ! &quot;
so we met in dec@@ ember in the se@@ at@@ room of a hotel hotel in mi@@
i &apos;ve tried to make clear the value of cities , like much more value they are than they cost . .
and i used this ch@@ art to show how valuable ro@@ hl@@ and is at a place like new york . think of that there is a square area in some cases per square meter of thousands of dollars .
but it was a pretty abstra@@ ct discussion on a place when there was a break , there was oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o , &quot; paul , maybe we could consider the ted@@ talk . &quot; .
so the ted@@ talk was in very simple form , so that a char@@ ter city is a place whose first un@@ in@@ hab@@ ited country is , a fo@@ unding contra@@ ct that &apos;s going to be there and the people who are there to decide either under those rules or not . . . . .
so i was asked by the president of hon@@ dur@@ as to be asked , who said we needed to be real , that this is important , and that this is the way our country
i was asked to come up to te@@ gu@@ ci@@ gal@@ pa and give birth to the fourth and fif@@ th of janu@@
so , i &apos;ve given another kind of facts with facts , which has a graph like this that has to try to indi@@ cate that if you want to create much value in a city , it &apos;s a very large city . .
this is a picture of den@@ ver , and the sk@@ et@@ ch represent the new air@@ port , which was made in den@@ ver
in the same way , that air@@ port has a temperature of 100
so i tried to convince the hon@@ dur@@ ans to make a new city , you have to start with an area of at least 1,000 square miles . . . . .
this is more than 250 thousand wars . . .
now , poli@@ te have all appl@@ au@@
the faces of the audience were very sever@@ e and accu@@ ra@@ cy
the head of con@@ gress came up on the stage and said , &quot; professor ro@@ mer , thank you very much for the talk , but could perhaps be the ted@@ talk . .
i have him here on my laptop here . &quot;
so i set out , and you played it off . ted@@
and i &apos;ve come to the core of the news that a new city gives people new possibilities . .
there would be the possibility in a city that would be in hon@@ dur@@ as , instead of hundreds of miles away from the north . . . .
and a new city also gradu@@ ates with new opportunities
the leaders in hon@@ dur@@ as would be depen@@ dent on the help of the local countries , they could benefit from their partner countries , they could benefit from their partner to the laws of this char@@ ter , and in the process , that everyone could trust that the char@@ ter is really per@@ v@@
and the reali@@ zation of president lo@@ bo , was that the confidence of trans@@ lation i thought about as a way of getting the foreign inv@@ e@@ stors to come to and build this city to build the same thing for all par@@ tis@@ ans in hon@@ dur@@ as , who have been under the years for many years , and dis@@ gu@@ sting . sc@@ ared and dis@@ gu@@
we this &apos;ve is enter@@ from ed this into
place an . area . .
it su@@ ms a thousand square miles . .
and shor@@ tly after@@ wards , on janu@@ ary 19@@ th , they were in con@@ gress &apos;s con@@ gress &apos;s change to have a com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sive market@@ place that &apos;s com@@ mon@@ ly com@@ pati@@ ble for specific areas .
in a country that has just sur@@ ve@@ yed a massive crisis , in con@@ gress that was ele@@ cted by con@@ gress at 1@@ 24 to a voice . a voice . . a voice
all par@@ ties , all the fra@@ ctions of society , suppor@@ ted this .
to be part of the const@@ it@@ ution , it has to be appro@@ ved by con@@ gress . .
on febru@@ ary 17@@ th , it was appro@@ ved for a voice for 1@@ 14 . portra@@
immediately , according to that ele@@ ction , between the 21@@ st and the 24@@ th , a ta@@ pe about 30 / 11 people who were most interested in the two places of the world who were most interested in the business of the city
one place is south korea .
this is a very large new city city , built in south korea , built wor@@ de@@ on -- big than the urban city .
all they can see in this picture was built within four years after it took the appro@@ val of appro@@ val .
the other place that was very interested in urban construction is sing@@ apo@@ re .
it so has if already you built think two of cities it in , china it ,
&apos;s and where the we third are is today in . prepar@@ ation . .
you already have a site site , and you already mention that area for second city . .
it &apos;s already being done on a legal system that management people are allowed to participa@@ te , and it &apos;s also being worked on an ex@@
a country has already off@@ ered its pri@@ or cour@@ t cour@@ t to be in cour@@ t for the dis@@ in@@ fle@@ c@@ tory of the local cour@@ t system .
it &apos;s also a city designer and construction workers . . .
they even bring fund@@ ing to the fact . .
one of the things that you know has been ti@@ ed to have been ti@@ ed to have been taken
there are many places that like to be tun@@ ed in america , especially in a place with a free trade zone , and there are lots of people who would like to live there . . .
there are 700 million people in the world who indi@@ cate that they want to live perman@@ ently on another place . .
a million people a year of la@@ tin america and migr@@ ant to the united states . .
many of you are fa@@ thers who are forced to re@@ store their families to be done -- sometimes it &apos;s a single mothers who have to make enough money to make their food and clo@@ thing .
unfortunately , sometimes sometimes even kids who are trying to find their parents back to each other they have seen in some cases for over a decade . for a decade .
so what is it for an idea to think about hon@@ dur@@ as a whole new city ? ? ?
or even du@@ m@@ b of these cities , or are there st@@ ag@@ ger@@ ed around the world ?
so what is it for an idea to ins@@ ist that every family has a choice between several cities that are facing compe@@ tent to new citizens ? ? competi@@ tors
that &apos;s an idea worth spre@@ ading .
so my friends from hon@@ dur@@ as asked me to say , thank you ted .
do do you you know know how how many many choices choices they they
make make in in a a typical typical day week ? ?
i &apos;ve been po@@ ll@@ ed a po@@ ll with over 2,000 american people , and the average number of decisions that are doing so , a typical american on one day
and also , recently , a study with ce@@ os did a study with ce@@ os , which is the ce@@ os .
and these scientists have just docum@@ ented the various top@@ ics with these ce@@ o hab@@ its , and how much time they spent making decisions that related to the subje@@ cts . .
and what they found is that the average ce@@ o was emplo@@ yed by 13@@ 9 jobs a week .
and fif@@ of ty course percent , of each their of decisions the were the@@ made mes
within , nine of minutes course or , less has . been many . ,
only for about 12 percent of their decisions they used an hour or more of their time .
think about your own decisions .
do you know how many choices you &apos;re going to meet in the nine minutes are in the order of categ@@ ory
how good , do you think they &apos;re making decisions ? ? it
today i want to talk about one of the biggest decisi@@ on-@@ making problems of modern time , the decision over@@ tru@@ ste@@ -@@ over@@ -@@ aid problem
i want to talk about the problem and about some of the solutions
now , if i &apos;m talking about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers . .
if i ask you a question , raise it , because i &apos;m blind , only the hand when you want to burn some cal@@ ories .
otherwise , if i ask you a question , if i ask you a question , and you answer your answer , well , my first question for this is : are you ready to hear about decisi@@ on-@@
thank you .
when i was an graduate student at stanford , i went to this very , very , very ex@@ cep@@ tional work@@ place ; at least at the time , it was really ex@@ clu@@ sive . at
it was a shop that was dra@@ g@@ ger .
this business , it was almost like a pleasure ca@@ ke . . .
they had 250 different types of mu@@ star@@ d and fa@@ g and over 500 different kinds of fru@@ it and vege@@ tables and more than two do@@ zen different ways of water -- and this was at a time when we actually had dr@@ un@@ k water water . . fu@@ cking
i loved it to go to this business ; but i &apos;ve been wonder@@ ing , well , how come you never buy something ? ?
here is the o@@ live oil gang . .
they had about 75 different o@@ live oil , including the ones that were en@@ ding , who came from a thousand year-old o@@ live trees . . old
so i decided one day to go to the fi@@ li@@ all@@ y-@@ oc@@ tober , and i asked the la@@ yers , &quot; does this model mean that you really provide the people all the way
and he poin@@ ted out on the bush char@@ ges of tou@@ ri@@ sts who came every day and used to fit their c@@ ameras .
so we decided to do an experiment , and we cho@@ se mar@@ mel@@ ate for our experiment
here &apos;s her mar@@ ching . a mar@@ g@@
they had 3@@ 4@@ 8 different kinds of mar@@ ital .
we &apos;ve put a little in@@ fir@@ m right on the ent@@ ry of the business . .
we put in six different ta@@ stes on mar@@ br@@ in or 24 different fla@@ vor@@ s of tun@@ ing , and we looked at two things : one , what if i could stay more people and try and try mar@@ mel@@ -@@ style ? ?
more people are sta@@ yed when there were 24 percent , about 60 percent when it were six , about 40 percent .
and after that , we looked at what case the people were buying a glass of a glass of animals . .
now we saw the rever@@ se effect .
from the people who sta@@ yed when there were 24 , only three percent bought a glass of a tun@@ e . .
from the people who sta@@ yed , when there were six , now we saw that 30 percent of you actually bought a glass of a mel@@ ting .
well , if you do math , people bought six times more of a tun@@ e , who had six to give for reven@@ ue when they had 24 to ele@@ ction . . .
now to decide , not buying a glass of glass is probably good for you -- at least it &apos;s good for our ta@@ pe -- but it turns out that decisi@@ on-@@ over@@ -@@ over@@ -@@ over@@ -@@ over@@ -@@ gener@@ ating problems are actually influ@@ enced by very con@@ test
we don &apos;t choose to decide , even if it comes against our own best inter@@ ests .
so , the theme of the day : financial sav@@ ings . .
i &apos;m going to show you now a study that i did with gu@@ r hu@@ ber@@ man , who kam@@ e kam@@ ber@@ er , who i did , and i did , in fact , in the decisions that we have to make decisions for the plans for r@@ r , almost a million
and what we &apos;ve looked at was whether the number of f@@ on@@ d@@ man services that were possible to do a reti@@ re@@ ment plan that &apos;s going to impact the li@@ ke@@ li@@ hood of whether more for tomorrow is saving .
and we found that actually there was a cor@@ relation . .
in this case , we had about 6@@ 5@@ 7 hits to get people to something between two to 5@@ 9 different f@@ on@@ ds . . . .
and what we found was that the more this f@@ ond is off@@ ered , in fact , the more part of ten@@ sion
if you look at the extreme , the plans , the two fund calls , had a sub@@ tle regi@@ me in the se@@ vent@@ h audience , and yet they don &apos;t have that high as the way we want .
in now the it places turns that out nearly that 60 even f@@ if on@@ you ds &apos;re , feeling the self-@@ atten@@ en@@ u@@ ab@@ ation ling of
, the if se@@ there ven@@ were th more of opportunities the for percentage choices , , now even , then was , about it the has six@@ negative
so , ten@@ ded people who decided to participa@@ te in , rather , that the more opportunities are available to you , the more opportunities they could be able to get them
the more opportunities you can get to you , the more they put their whole money in r@@ ent boo@@ n@@ els .
none of these extreme decisions bel@@ on@@ ged to the decisions that someone &apos;s re@@ cep@@ ti@@ red to people when they &apos;re important to their future financial well-@@ being . . .
now , over the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three of the most important negative consequences with people who are involved in the
they push the decision -- push them , they even move against their own be@@ am . . interesting . .
they tend to make worse decisions -- worse financial and worse medical decisions . .
they &apos;re getting more to do things that they make even less , even if they do obje@@ ctive better . .
and the main reason for this is that we might enjoy these huge rain@@ cal@@ ves full of an old t@@ all , na@@ f , v@@ g and mar@@ mel@@ y , but we don &apos;t actually have the compar@@ ison and cros@@ sing dis@@ orders and then actually can pick something out of the fanta@@ sti@@ cal supply
so what i &apos;d like to suggest to you today are four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve been testing in different ways and different research in different ways -- that just can apply them in the business . .
first , nar@@ row .
they &apos;ve heard it before , but it never really was , that less people are . less . .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; limit@@ s . &quot;
they always make sure they lose the surface . . .
but we &apos;re really seeing it , and it &apos;s more and more , that if you &apos;re willing to restri@@ ct , and you &apos;ll lose the rema@@ ining op@@ tions , well then there &apos;s a rise in sal@@ es , it will be cut up , you know , you &apos;re going to have a cost of the cost of the
when pro@@ ctor and gam@@ ble , the different head and comm@@ and of each of the 26 super@@ up , they did a rate of sal@@ es about 10 percent . in sal@@
when the gol@@ den c@@ at corpo@@ ration was going to be taken her 10 most of the cal@@ c@@ as , they found that the w@@ ins were about 8@@ 7 percent -- a result of both the sal@@ es of sal@@ es and re@@ duc@@ ing cost .
you know , the average super@@ ma@@ cr@@ o today , you off@@ end 4@@ 5,000 products .
a typical wal@@ m@@ art is off@@ ering you 100,000 products today .
but the nin@@ th largest super@@ market , which is the world &apos;s largest super@@ market in the world , al@@ di , and they only offer them 1,@@ 400 products -- a kind of to@@ ma@@ to sau@@ ce in do@@ ses . . in
now in the world of sav@@ ings , i believe one of the best examples that have come out of the market recently , about how best they have been to the choices , to how best they have been in the order of choice , is something that is off@@ ered at harvard . , it
every single harvard is carrying now to a lifetime of life . . . .
the ones that really want to say , 20 f@@ on@@ ds are off@@ ered , are going to have to have 300 f@@
you know , people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to tell it .
they &apos;re all important opportunities . &quot;
and the first thing i did is , tell me how the possibilities are different from one another . . . .
and they can &apos;t stand apart , and their custom@@ ers don &apos;t exist , but their custom@@ ers
now before we started this morning , i had a conversation with g@@ ary . . . .
and g@@ ary said that he would be ready to offer all the people in this audience , including a single paid vac@@ ation in the world . a single bunch of people in the
here &apos;s a descri@@ ption of the street .
and i &apos;d like to read to you .
and now i &apos;ll give you a couple of seconds to read and say , if you &apos;re willing to take a little bit of a matter of g@@ ary &apos;s offer . .
okay . now , one of the ready to adop@@ t g@@ ary &apos;s off@@
so are all that ?
okay they , knew let it me was show a you trick a
, little right bit ? more of ? it . .
now , who is ready for this trip . .
i think i &apos;ve heard more hands . .
good . .
in fact they &apos;re reali@@ zing , the first time they had more information than when they first , but i would tell you a car that they were feeling in the second time . . , but i would
because the images it li@@ f@@ ts it for them .
and what brings me to the second technology that will help them deal with the problem of decisi@@ on-@@ la@@ sting , it &apos;s the
it &apos;s about people who understand the difference between opportunities , understanding what the consequences are associated with the individual possibilities , and that we need to be comfortable and in@@ ju@@ red to . . . . . . . . .
why do people spend average 15 to 30 percent more if they use a ec@@ o map or a credit card than in bar@@ ker ? ? money ?
because it &apos;s not really true to the money .
and it turns out that when you manage something that feels con@@ cre@@ te , it &apos;s a very good tool , so you can get people to save
so we have a study that i made in a study that i did with s@@ hl@@ om@@ o ben@@ ar@@ tz@@ i , and al@@ ess@@ and@@ r@@ o , we did a study with the people on tr@@ um@@ pe@@ d@@ al -- employees that worked on touch -- and these people were all in a gather@@ ed in a gather@@ ed in which
and during that gather@@ ing , we &apos;ve just left these conven@@ tion as well as it was , just ad@@ ding a small issue . .
the little thing that we &apos;ve made to ins@@ ist was that we asked people to just think about all the positive things that would happen in their lives if they
in which we did these simple things , there was an increase in atten@@ dance about 20 percent , and there was a rise in the number of people who were willing to save or go up by four percent of the sav@@ ings that they were willing to pay
the third technology : categ@@ ori@@ zation . .
we can better deal with more of these than more choice than with more choice
so , for example , here &apos;s a study we made in a magazine . .
it turns out there &apos;s this down@@ man@@ thetic at the top and down in the nor@@ the@@ astern area , the number of times 3@@ 3@@ 1 species of maga@@ zin@@ es up to 6@@ 6@@ 4 maga@@ zin@@ es . in the new@@ spa@@ pers . up to
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 pa@@ pers and you spli@@ t it in 10 categ@@ ories , or i &apos;ll show 400 maga@@ zin@@ es , and you &apos;ll have them in 20 categ@@ ories , you think i &apos;ll have more choice and a better choice than i gave you the 400 , you know , i gave you more choice and i have given the
because the categ@@ ories tell me how to hold them apart .
so here are two different je@@ wel@@ ry results .
one is &quot; ja@@ zz &quot; and the other is called s@@ wing . . is called
if you think the left display is per@@ forming s@@ wing , and the ad on the right is ja@@ zz , you &apos;ll cla@@ p in
okay , there are a couple .
if you think that the ones on the left hand is ja@@ zz , and the ones on the right side , you &apos;re appl@@ ying .
okay , a couple more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
on the left , ja@@ zz and the right is s@@ wing , but you know what ? . you ?
this is a highly in@@ hel@@ bat@@ ant categ@@ ory . .
the categ@@ ories need to tell the extra@@ ctor to be a choice , not the sele@@ ction .
and this problem often , you see , is when you look at the long bul@@ ks all of these top bul@@
who do you want to in@@ form that ? ?
my fourth technology : predi@@ ction for complexity .
it turns out we can actually be able to do more information than we think we just need to simpli@@ fy them . . . .
we need to increase complexity slowly . .
i &apos;ll give you an example of what i mean . . .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : the car on a car
here &apos;s a ger@@ man auto@@ maker , who gives you the opportunity to actually con@@ figure her car . . .
they have to make 6@@ 2 different decisions to make their car completely . .
now these decisions are different from the number of choices they offer each decision . .
car colors , opposite color of the car -- i have 5@@ 6 possibilities . .
mot@@ ors , ge@@ ar -- four possibilities .
now what i do is i change the order that makes decisions come . . . . .
half the custom@@ ers are pas@@ sing by the many ways of the 5@@ 6 cars to the low ways that are four pro@@ pos@@ als . four .
the other half of the cli@@ ents are taking the ones that have the ones that are in the first place , four different cars , many possibilities . .
what am i looking at ? ?
how do they care about it .
when what you you use find the is de@@ that fau@@ the lt people choice who in are the going decision to , have it the means ones you that &apos;re have over@@
the -@@ ones challen@@ to ged the , very the low most choice hot over , and i over &apos;m again losing . it . choice . . .
we are losing them .
go from the little choices to the many , stay at that . . .
they &apos;re the same information . it &apos;s the same set of possibilities .
the only thing i did is the order of change in which this information is being pres@@ ented . . .
when i start with the simple start , i just learn how to choose
even though the ge@@ ar is sele@@ ction , i &apos;m not telling anything about my pre@@ fer@@ ences in the inter@@ ior , still pre@@ p@@ are me out . .
it also puts me excited in the big product i put together , and i &apos;m ready to make me feel interested in this . . .
let me wra@@ p up .
i told you about four techniques that are changing the problem of decisi@@ on-@@ la@@ sting , ste@@ aling -- will you be able to do the ex@@ cess alterna@@ te , you know , consi@@ der@@ ation -- you &apos;re doing it real ; categ@@ ori@@ tion@@ -@@ cent@@ r@@ alized , categ@@ ori@@ tion@@ i@@ zes --
each of these techniques that i &apos;m descri@@ bing to you today is to help them manage the possibility of man@@ aging -- good for them , they can use them for themselves , good for the people you serve . for
because i think that the key to the best possible choice is that you &apos;re choo@@ sing . . .
and the more we &apos;re going to pick up sel@@ ec@@ ting pi@@ sel@@ ical the art , the better we &apos;re going to be able to practice
thank you . .
hi . i &apos;m kev@@ in the ze@@ c@@ ca , and i &apos;m a job of youtube , i &apos;m looking at youtube video video .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how video gro@@ ws wide , and then after@@ wards that &apos;s important , that &apos;s what it
we all want to be stars -- cele@@ bri@@ ties , sing@@ ers , com@@ edi@@ an -- when i was young , it seemed so infin@@ itely difficult . . . .
but web videos have provi@@ des that we can all be surprised or all of our creative activi@@ ties in a part of our world &apos;s culture . . . .
and every single one of you could be famous about the internet to the next satur@@
but at youtube more than 4@@ 8 hours of video , more than 4@@ 8 hours of video
it &apos;s going to be a tiny percentage of it ever , and it &apos;s going to be thousands of times , and it &apos;s
so how does it work ?
three things : ta@@ ste@@ maker , par@@ tial parts of the un@@ expected . .
well , let &apos;s go there .
oh my god . oh my god . .
oh my god ! !
wo@@ o@@ -@@ .
o@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h , wo@@ w@@ w@@ w ! !
last year , the only jo@@ ined &quot; vas@@ vas@@ que@@ z jo@@ ined this video that he photograph@@ ed before his house in the yo@@ se@@
in 2010 , it had been taken up 23 million times .
this ch@@ art shows how it looked as the first month was popular for the first time .
in he fact just , wanted not to a share vi@@ an ral eg@@ video va wanted
. to make . . . . . . .
because you &apos;re going to do that , you know , you &apos;re designing yo@@ se@@ mi@@ te
he had been u@@ plo@@ aded all sorts of natural videos .
and this video was actually finished in janu@@ ary already in janu@@ ary . .
what happened here ? ?
this came up here j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@
j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ mel ended the t@@ we@@ et that was more popular . popular . popular . .
because ta@@ ste@@ maker like j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ ve will ask us new and interesting things and show you a big audience . .
it &apos;s the fri@@ day , fri@@ day , e@@ ta han@@ g on the fri@@ day , and everyone &apos;s going to go on the school line , wee@@ k@@ ward , fri@@ day , fri@@ day . &apos; fri@@ day &apos; fri@@ day &apos; fri@@ day &apos; fri@@ day &apos; fri@@ day &apos; one i did not think we would have this conversation ,
re@@ bec@@ ca bl@@ ac@@ k : fri@@ day &quot; is one of the world &apos;s most popular videos .
it was almost about 200 million times this year . .
this is what the graphi@@ cs look like . .
just like &quot; the &quot; double rain@@ bo@@ w &quot; seems to be out of no@@ where . . it seems .
what happened to this day ? that
well , it was fri@@ day , that &apos;s right .
if you were to know : those other ti@@ ps are too free . . .
but what about that day , this particular fri@@ day day ?
well , to@@ sh@@ ine 0 for@@ sted , lots of blogs started to write about it .
michael j@@ . nel@@ son from myster@@ y science theater was a first to say that he made a jo@@ ke on twitter . .
what &apos;s important is that a single person or a group of ta@@ ste@@ makers took a point of a stand with a big audience and then acceler@@ ating the process . .
then , by then , this community of people who shared this great insi@@ de , and started talking about playing with it . playing around .
now there &apos;s 10,000 par@@ o@@ dies in &quot; fri@@ day &quot; at youtube . .
already in the first seven days there was a par@@ o@@ dy for every single wee@@ k-@@ end . .
in other words , from the traditional enter@@ tainment enter@@ prise , the community partici@@ p@@ ating our way of becoming a part of this phenomenon -- either by spre@@ ading it or doing something new . .
&quot; n@@ y@@ an c@@ at &quot; is anima@@ tion and music in end@@ less@@ ness . . .
it &apos;s , quite simple . .
this year it was taken almost 50 million times . .
and if you &apos;re really sorry that you should know that there &apos;s a three-@@ hour version that &apos;s been looked at four million times . is looking at four
even cat@@ s are watching this video .
cat@@ s are watching cat@@ s that watch this video .
it &apos;s important that creativity , that is in the internet culture of the tech@@ man &apos;s culture . . . .
there were re@@ mix@@ es .
somebody made an ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned version of that
and then it became international .
a whole re@@ co@@ de community took out of the ground , which was made by a stupid jo@@ ke to something that we could all participa@@ te . .
we don &apos;t just find pleasure in the world ; we &apos;re not
who could have been able to see that ? ?
who could have predi@@ cted &quot; the foun@@ ca , &quot; re@@ bec@@ ca black or &quot; n@@ y@@ an c@@ at &quot; ? ?
what &apos;s the writer in@@ her@@ ently writing in which things are possible ? that &apos;s what &apos;s
in a world where every minute of two days is u@@ plo@@ aded by video , only unique and un@@ expected appe@@ ar@@ ance as the video that i mentioned . . the video that
i ad@@ mit i wasn &apos;t really interested in a lot of interest when a friend told me i was watching this great video of a guy who was prote@@ sted in new york against bi@@ cy@@ cles .
i got a ti@@ cket because i &apos;m not on the bi@@ ke side , but often there are dis@@ abilities that i &apos;m going to let you rely on the bi@@ ke side . . .
and since that was completely surprising and mur@@ der@@ ly , cas@@ ey was demon@@ str@@ ating , cas@@ ey sim@@ o was an idea and
this is a shift for everything new we do . . .
and this all takes us to a big question . .
what does that mean ?
o@@ h@@ h@@ h . .
what does that mean ?
ta@@ ste@@ maker , creative partici@@ pants , totally un@@ expected , are the fe@@ atures of a new kind of media and culture that everyone has access and where the audience is determin@@ ing the popular part . . . . .
as i said , one of the currently largest stars -- ju@@ stin bie@@ ber -- made his first story at youtube . . . .
nobody needs to give up your ideas green . .
and we also feel like we &apos;re all ma@@ ma@@ ts of our po@@ p@@ culture
and these are not the fe@@ atures of old media , and they &apos;re very har@@ dly active to be the media of today , but they &apos;re going to deter@@ mine the future
thank you .
how do i talk about the inter@@ connec@@ te@@ dness between women over three generations , and how the amazing strength of these inter@@ connec@@ te@@ dness is the same , as it was , 30 years ago , with her little sister , her mother and grandmother , were in five days with her little sister , her mother and grandmother , five days and ni@@ ght@@ fully in the chinese sea in the chinese in the chinese , and a vi@@ br@@ ant that didn &apos;t get worse in the life of this little girl who was never in san francisco
the story is not passed . .
it i &apos;s want a to puzz@@ tell le you that about &apos;s some
going of to the be puzz@@ put le together bits . .
imagine the first bit : a man bur@@ st a living piece of life
he &apos;s a po@@ et , a writer , a guy whose whole life was brought from the simple hope of unity and freedom . . . . .
hold it with the commun@@ ist in sa@@ ig@@ on , when you &apos;re in the face of the commun@@ ist in sa@@ ig@@ on , he
the words , as long as his friends , spo@@ t@@ ched his .
he he moved died back , to broke
the through sil@@ the ence story . .
he &apos;s my grand@@ father .
i never met it personally . .
but our lives are so much more than our memor@@ ies .
my grandmother never for@@ got me to ever ever forget
i had to make it not for free , and it was my task to learn that history was starting to s@@ we@@ ak around , we were getting over it . . . .
the next piece of the puzz@@ le is like running a boat in early hom@@ ing red on sea . . a boat .
my mom may have 18 , when her father died -- already in a ar@@ ran@@ ged marriage , had two little girls . . at
for them , life had a qu@@ est : the flight of their family and a new life in australia . . life .
it was completely ex@@ clu@@ ded to that , that you could fail . .
after a four@@ -year-old and movie ri@@ ce of sa@@ g@@ a gli@@ cy , he was a boat behind the sea as a fishing boat . . . .
all the adults were aware of the risks
the biggest sc@@ ared was they had pi@@ rate , ra@@ pe and death
like most adults on the boat , my mother , a little fan bottle , they have a little
when my sister and i would have been a pris@@ on@@ er , and i &apos;d be drin@@ king them and
my first memor@@ ies are from this boat -- the ever@@ -@@ ti@@ pping of the engine , the cla@@ pping of every wave on the bu@@ g , the range and the rest of
i don &apos;t remember the pi@@ rate that came from many times , but from the death of men on our boat , or the ab@@ sen@@ ce of the engine , the six hours didn &apos;t want to go . .
but i remember the lights of the oil field outside the mal@@ a@@ y@@ an coast , and the young man who broke up and died , the end of the journey , was too much for him , and on the taste of the first ap@@ b that i gave to one of the men on the
no apple has ever done so again . .
after three months in a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e camp , we ended up in mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne .
and the next piece of this piece is by four women in three generations that came together to build a new life .
we went into foot@@ pan@@ ics , one by the working class , whose population was born in mi@@ gration , and it &apos;s been a population
unlike the ol@@ d-@@ lived midd@@ le-@@ class sub@@ ur@@ bs , their existence was entirely un@@ known , there was no more sophisticated thinking in foot@@ ball . . . .
the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ds from the la@@ shu@@ ds came from the rest of the
and the bre@@ e@@ ks were broken among people who had one thing in common : they started getting new . . . . .
my mother worked on far@@ ming , then on a fli@@ p line in a car factory , six days twice la@@ yers .
and they kind of managed to find the time that they &apos;re doing in english
we were poor .
every dollar got shared and put in more education in another school and math , no matter what we needed to do , because the new things that came out of two hands were always made of two hands . . . the
two str@@ ings of school for school , each to cover the holes in the other . .
school form to the butt@@ ons , because they had to pay six years . . . .
and there were the rare people who were pain@@ ful , pain@@ ful ch@@ u@@ met , &quot; and here &apos;s the painting : &quot; asi@@ an , go home . &quot;
home where ? home ?
something that was en@@ han@@ ced in me .
there was a meeting to re@@ con@@ ci@@ le and a quie@@ t voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go to you .
my mother , my sister and i sle@@ pt in the same bed .
my mom was ex@@ hau@@ sted every night , but we were telling each other from our day , and we heard about the movement of our grandmother in the house
my mom suff@@ ered from al@@ p@@ dream from the boat . .
and it was my task , every night , to stay up until her al@@ p@@ dreams came to wo@@ ke her
she opened a computer business , then did a co@@ s@@ me@@ ti@@ an training , and then
and women came along with their stories about men who didn &apos;t com@@ mit the change and in@@ flexi@@ ble , and re@@ com@@ men@@ ded kids tra@@ pped between the two worl@@ ds
dar@@ le@@ ses and spon@@ sor@@ s were se@@ arch@@ ed
centers were built . .
i lived in par@@ all@@ el@@ al areas .
in one i was the classi@@ c asi@@ an student , the un@@ com@@ pati@@ ble dem@@ ands for themselves . . .
and the other thing i &apos;ve been involved in in un@@ certain life is the tra@@ gic an@@ atom@@ ars of the violence , the drug ab@@ use and the isol@@ ation . .
but so many of the people got help .
and because of this aid , i was ex@@ posed to the last year of the year of ju@@ ven@@ i , as young austr@@ ali@@ an of the
and i got to the next cat@@ ap@@ ul@@ ted , and i did the ed@@ ges fit . . . . .
tan le , anony@@ mous indian from foot@@ sc@@ ra@@ ys , was now tan , re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e and social activ@@ ist who was invited to pro@@ mote to be popular from places they had never heard , and in houses their existence they could never have imag@@
i didn &apos;t know the lab@@ el . .
i didn &apos;t know how to fix this ste@@ ep@@ y . .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go back to r@@ out@@ ine , and the conven@@ i@@ ence of the life of an un@@ known predi@@ ction -- a grandmother , a mother and two dau@@ gh@@ ters who were sitting in every day as well as 20 years , by telling the stories of the day , and putting the stories on the day . . . .
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
she remin@@ ded me that i was now as old as she was taking her boat out . . .
no , it &apos;s never been a way
&quot; do it just said , &quot; she said . &quot; and not what you &apos;re not . &quot; &quot;
so i talked about ju@@ ven@@ i@@ an and training , and the ne@@ ar@@ by of mar@@ g@@ in@@ alized and dis@@ count . . . . . .
and the more i talked , the more i should tell you . . .
i met some people in all the gro@@ und@@ ings of what they loved , as many of them were what they loved in the boundar@@ ies of the possible
and although i gradu@@ ated , i realized i couldn &apos;t find myself with a career in j@@ ur@@ a .
there must be another puzz@@ le on this . . .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a out@@ si@@ der , a new ch@@ as@@ t@@ le@@ a@@ tic , new picture -- and not just okay , but something you need to be gr@@ ate@@ ful , maybe a gift of the
because in addition to inclu@@ ding the collapse of the horizon@@ tal cycle , it can mean that you &apos;re accep@@ ted to embra@@ ce the assu@@ mp@@ tions of the environment .
now i &apos;ve gone out enough from my be@@ am space to know that , yes , the world is collap@@ sing but not how you fear it . .
possibilities that would not have been allowed to be encoura@@ ged by possibilities .
there was a energy , an un@@ com@@ promis@@ ing optimis@@ m , a strange soft@@ b@@ aus of the hu@@ mili@@ ty and the wa@@
so i followed my gut feeling .
i would collect a small team of people who were making the sho@@ e &quot; no resi@@ stance challenge . . . . . .
one year we had no 10@@ th . .
i ended up with a huge de sou@@ p , and we shared with each other . . .
we worked late until late , late late
most of our ideas were crazy , but they were a pair of brilliant ones , and we created
i met the decision to pull in the united states
just my a gut trip feeling
there again . .
three months later , i was moved and the ad@@ vent@@ ure continu@@ ed . . .
before i close the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother
she grew up at a time when con@@ fu@@ z@@ ism was the social nor@@ m and the local mand@@ ar@@ in . the most important person . .
life had not changed for cent@@ u@@ ries .
her father was about to die shor@@ tly after her
her mother was on her house .
she was 17 , she was on a san@@ it@@ or , her mother beat her .
without the support of your husband , she made her a sen@@ sation by taking him in trial and was in the case of a much larger way than she won . , and a much greater
&quot; don &apos;t get it . &quot; it &apos;s un@@ true .
i was just du@@ mp@@ ed in a hotel room in sy@@ dney when she died . 1,000 miles away in mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne .
i looked through the cra@@ b wall and saw them on the other side . .
i knew they came to say go@@ od@@ b@@ ye . .
my mother gave me a few minutes after@@
a few days later , we went to a budd@@ h@@ ist temp@@ le in foot@@ ball p@@ sc@@ ases and sa@@ iling their sar@@ g
we told her stories and in@@ sur@@ ance that we were still at her .
and in mid@@ night , the mon@@ k came along and said he needed to close the sar@@ mo@@
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
she asked the mon@@ k , &quot; why is your hand so warm and then the rest of your hand is so cold ? &quot; ?
&quot; because they &apos;re keeping them this morning , &quot; he said . .
&quot; they left them . &quot; . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s through women . , it &apos;s about
and you see who we were and how life has sha@@ ped us , we can now see that the men who might have origin@@ ated in our lives would be really up@@ set
the de@@ fe@@ at would have been simple .
now i &apos;d have to have my own kids , and i still think that boat .
who would ever want to wish one ? ?
yes , i &apos;m afraid of privi@@ lege , pri@@ mor@@ ty , outside of ad@@ vo@@ c@@ acy
can i give you a bu@@ g in your life , who is in coura@@ ge@@ ous every wave , who is un@@ lo@@ cked , and ste@@ aling tu@@ ck@@ ers of the engine , the long hori@@ zon that doesn &apos;t even guar@@
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this , and you could definitely get through it , i would do it
and also , t@@ ans &apos;s mother today is in the fourth or five series . .
i &apos;m here to share my photograph@@ y with you
is it all photograph@@ y at all
because of course , this is a picture you can &apos;t record with your camera . .
and yet , my interest in photograph@@ y , when i was in my first digital camera , was in the age
and i put it with my former pre@@ ven@@ tion of drawing , but it was a little different , because using the camera was a lot of the process of
and when you take a picture with a camera , it ends up when you press the fuel . .
so to me it seemed more like this photograph@@ y to be at the right time at the right time .
i believed everybody could . . .
so i wanted to create something else , something that process is starting when it &apos;s being pres@@ sed . .
pictures like this : one construction site along there is a much more f@@
but and it yet has , an re@@ un@@ pair expected an turn reali@@
. stic level . . . . . .
or photographs like this -- dark and color@@ ful , but all with the common obje@@ ctive to keep a reali@@ stic level . . .
when i say reality , i mean &quot; photo@@ reality . &quot; .
because , of course , she &apos;s not something you can capture , but i would always like to make it look like you could have had it on a photograph . .
and so i it think &apos;s of more a about brief cap@@ moment turing to an get idea
the as idea really out a . moment . . . . .
but what is the trick that makes it more reali@@ stic ?
is it all about the details or the colors ?
is what it does about the the illusion
light create ? ? ? ?
sometimes the perspective is illusion . .
but after all , it &apos;s about how we interpre@@ t the world , and how can you be made in a two-@@ dimensional area . .
it &apos;s not about what is reali@@ stic , but what we think is a very reali@@ stic .
so i think the principles are very simple . .
i see them as a j@@ ar of reality , and you can take a different kind of reality , and to put together different pieces of reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
so we have three perfectly imag@@ in@@ able physical objects that we can all identify with in a three-@@ dimensional world . . .
but in a certain way , combin@@ ed with each other , you can create something that looks still like three-@@ dimensional as if
but at the same time , we know that it &apos;s not possible
so we over@@ li@@ er your brains , because our brain just simply doesn &apos;t make it really , it &apos;s not really really
and i see the same process in combin@@ ation of photographs .
it &apos;s really just about combin@@ ing different reali@@ ties .
so things that make a reali@@ stic picture , i think it &apos;s the things we don &apos;t think about , the things around us in our everyday lives . things around us .
but if we com@@ bine pictures , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise you &apos;re sort of
so i would like to say that there are three simple rules to come up with a reali@@ stic result .
and but as , you you can know see , , you these
can are do not something three special special like images this . .
so the first rule is that combin@@ ed photos should be the same perspective .
secon@@ dly , they should have combin@@ ed photos . . .
and these two pictures fill these two dem@@ ands -- from the same al@@ al@@ ity , and the same ill@@ umin@@ ating species . .
third , it &apos;s about making it impossible to make it clear where the individual images start and end by putting them into se@@ am@@ less@@ ly
make it impossible to say , in fact , the picture was put together
so , by compar@@ ing paint , contr@@ ast and bri@@ ght@@ ness to the ed@@ ges of the individual images , tra@@ ding photogra@@ phic rat , like wild@@ dep@@ th , and dis@@ orders , we &apos;re scre@@ aming the boundar@@ ies between the different images and let them look like a single photograph , although a picture is basically capable of hundreds of levels . . con@@ tains . a
here &apos;s another example . .
you might think that this is just a landscape of landscape , and it &apos;s mani@@ pul@@ ated by the bottom bit .
but in fact , this picture is completely com@@ posed , colle@@ cted by photographs of
i personally found a place called a place , to find a place , because you don &apos;t have to go into a com@@ promise and you can &apos;t get your ideas in your head
but it requires a lot of planning . .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew i &apos;d had a couple of months to plan it to plan the different places for the pieces of the puzz@@ le .
for example , the fish had been taken on a sh@@ ore . a
the bank came from a different place . .
the under@@ water part is from a quar@@ ry . . .
and yeah , i &apos;ve even color@@ ed the house on the top of the island to make it flo@@ at . .
to reach a more reali@@ stic out@@ come , i found out , looked at it on
i always start with a sk@@ et@@ ch , an idea .
after and that here , &apos;s it every &apos;s piece about
of combin@@ very ation well-@@ of plan@@ different ned images .
and then when you take good pictures , the result is pretty beautiful , and also pretty reali@@ stic . reali@@ stic .
so , it &apos;s all available to be there , and the only thing that mi@@ mi@@ cs us is our
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electr@@ onic health projects fail
and i think the most important thing is we stopped talking about our patients . . .
and one of the things we &apos;ve been doing on the bi@@ b@@ poli@@ d-@@ at university was to take a major audience . .
it &apos;s not particularly scienti@@ fically about this -- she &apos;s making a c@@ up of coffee or a te@@ t and asks the patients , families , rela@@ tives , &quot; how are we ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems why everyone -- maybe most of the electr@@ onic health projects are missing , because we stopped listening . . .
this is my w@@ lan@@ -@@ wa@@ ni@@ vi@@ an . very simple thing .
she &apos;s got a butt@@ on on a number . .
and every morning i go on that . .
and yes , i have a problem , as you might recognize . .
i put my job at 95 king . .
simple , it &apos;s just working , every time i walk on the cal@@ m , it &apos;s going to be my data on google health . health
and they also called it from my general identity , so it can tell where my weight is , not only in the moment i need car@@ di@@ ology support or so , but also a gli@@ mp@@ se into the past . . . . .
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe you know what i &apos;ve got about 4@@ ,000 follo@@ wers on twitter . . .
so every morning i jum@@ ped on my w@@ um and people talk with me before i &apos;m in the car , &quot; i &apos;m just going to lunch a little sal@@ ad today , lu@@ ci@@ d . &quot;
but that &apos;s the lat@@ est thing that can happen because it &apos;s the group forced to help groups , because it could be used against the can@@ en@@ a , or it could be de@@ plo@@ yed patients to get a smo@@ ke . . ,
but it could also be used to get people out of their cha@@ irs , and to get them to play some kind of play in their health . to control their health . . . .
the next week , that &apos;s going to go to the market
it will give this little blood pressure device that acts on an iphone or something . .
and it &apos;s going to en@@ able people to measure their blood pressure , send it to their doctor and share it for them for some more than 100 dollars . for a little over 100 dollars
now at that point , these are the patients in the game , they can &apos;t just take control , give money on their own ship , but also rel@@ ent@@ less to help us in health care about the challenges that are ahead of us , and the cost explosion of public health , dou@@ ble@@ -@@ demand ,
make the ways that are easy to use and capture with that , patients in the team . .
and you can do that through these kinds of things , but also through crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing .
and one of the things we &apos;ve done is , i &apos;d like to share with you a little short video
we all have navi@@ gation systems in our cars . .
maybe even in our mobile phones . . . .
we know exactly where every money of money is around the a@@ a@@ stri@@ cht . .
we know one more thing , where the sta@@ tions are . .
and but sure where enough would , the we next can a@@ find ed fast go
food to chain help . this patient . ? . ?
we asked them , and nobody knew .
nobody so knew what where did the we next do life@@ ? -@@ we saving did a@@ crow@@ ed d@@ was sour@@
going ced to crow@@ find d@@ up sour@@ at ced that . moment . . . .
we created an intern@@ al record and asked a human population , &quot; if you see an a@@ ed , please tell you where he is , when he has , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed out of business , of course . . . time .
and over 10,000 a@@ e@@ ters have already ga@@ ined in the ne@@ ther@@ lands . . .
the and next we step designed was an to i@@ find pad the ap@@ app@@
p s . . . . . .
we &apos;ve created an ap@@ p for la@@ y@@ ar , and we &apos;ve been exp@@ and@@ ed reality to find these
and if you &apos;re in a city like ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht , and someone cra@@ w@@ ling together , you can use your iphone , and within the next few weeks , you can use micro@@ -@@ computer to save the next a@@ .@@ r@@ . saving
and today , we &apos;re expe@@ cting not only to be a@@ ed@@ le@@ u , like the product called , but also to bring in a@@ ed@@ bro@@ us . . . .
and we want to bring this to a global level . .
and we ask our colleagues all over the world , from other universi@@ ties , to help us be@@ have like k@@ is@@ ses in the world to crow@@ d@@ source these a@@ e@@ ds all over the world . a lot of these a@@ e@@ ds in the
and if you &apos;re in vac@@ ation and someone cra@@ ws together , it &apos;s your own way of your own body , or somebody else , you can find an a@@ ims
the other thing we want to ask is that companies around the world are helping us to help us in con@@ fir@@ ma@@ tion of that age . . .
these could be cu@@ ri@@ -@@ like services , or techni@@ cians , for example , just to make sure that the custom@@ er is still in its place .
please help us and try to make health not just improve something , but take the hand . . . . .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to report from un@@ expected disco@@ ver@@ ies .
i work in solar technology industri@@ es . .
and my little star@@ tu@@ p would be able to force us by doing ... by making ...
... here it &apos;s &apos;s a a short crow@@ video d@@ of
sour@@ what cing we re@@ &apos;re view doing . .
oh . a moment . . .
it &apos;ll take you to be invited for it
so -- we can ski@@ p this way -- i &apos;m going to just leave the video off . off
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
solar technology is ...
oh , my time is past ? my
okay . thank you . .
so a couple of years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design to take out a year and work in an environment that &apos;s pretty much like , what they &apos;re going to hate , we &apos;ve been working on government . .
the program is called code for america , and it &apos;s a bit like peace of peace for computer ge@@ e@@ ks . .
we pick some ro@@ und@@ wal@@ ts every year and we &apos;re going to work them with city di@@ als
so instead of sending it into the third world , we send them in ra@@ th@@ houses . . .
and they developed great app@@ s where they worked with urban workers . . .
but what you &apos;re really doing is show what is possible with technology . . .
so they make al .
al is a hy@@ dr@@ ant in boston . . .
here it looks like he &apos;s looking at a date , but what he really is looking for is somebody who &apos;s thro@@ wing him out when he &apos;s in his conven@@ tion , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at the br@@ and@@ ed position when he &apos;s covered by his foot . s@@ no@@ wed
how did he get to look for this particular way of help ? ? how he
we had a team of rock wh@@ ol@@ l last year in boston , the code for america .
they and were they there realized in that febru@@ the ary city , is and never it li@@ &apos;s f@@ got
ted much to more this cour@@ hy@@ tes@@ dr@@ y ant last . febru@@ ary . . .
but a particular fellow , a man named er@@ ik mand@@ el@@ s-@@ ob@@ der , found something else , and that was that the people were getting out of the si@@ de@@ wal@@ ks right in front of these . .
so he did what any good develop@@ er would do , he wrote an ap@@ p .
it &apos;s a nice little ap@@ p where you can adop@@ t a hy@@ dr@@ ant . .
you were wrong to scre@@ w him up , when it &apos;s quick .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you do not do that , somebody can take away from it .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic . . .
this is a hum@@ ble little ap@@ p .
it &apos;s probably the small@@ est app@@ s of 21 app@@ s that the ro@@ ws have written in the last
but she does something that no other government technology does . .
it &apos;s spre@@ ading up rapi@@ dly .
there &apos;s the guy in the i@@ .@@ t. ab@@ tel department of the city of hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u , who &apos;s been using the ap@@ p , not for s@@ now , but for the citizens of tsun@@ ami , the citizens were adop@@ ting the tsun@@ ami
it &apos;s very important that these tsun@@ am@@ i@@ -@@ si@@ ghts work , but people ste@@ al batter@@ ies . . .
so he got the citizens to check them . .
and then se@@ attle decided to get the ap@@ p to get people to clean up the bu@@ p@@ pe@@ ts .
and chicago just introduced it to the bu@@ re@@ c@@ ates , so that people blo@@ wing the bu@@ re@@ ri@@ ty off when they run .
we now know nine cities , which are planning to use these ap@@ p .
and she spread very dis@@ gu@@ sting , organic , natural . . .
you know , if you know about government technology , you &apos;re not usually going to work that way .
the creation of software takes a few years into the rule of
we had a team that worked on a project last year , for the three people , two and a half months . .
it was about a way of finding parents to find out that the right public school schools are for their
we told us later that if it were going over the normal can@@ als , it took over two years and it would have been paid over two million dollars . it would have
and that &apos;s nothing nothing .
there &apos;s currently a project in california that has been paying the ta@@ x transp@@ l@@ ant two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work . .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
so an ap@@ p that &apos;s written in a few days , and then from sel@@ ec@@ ted , it &apos;s a kind of sound in front of the government that &apos;s going on in the
it shows how the government could work better -- no more like a private company , how many people think that it should
and not like a techni@@ que company , but rather like the web itself .
and that means liber@@ ating , which means that , open and productive . . .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly , it &apos;s about that ap@@ p , that she represents a new generation of the problem of government -- not as the problem of sal@@ es , but as a problem of collective action , but as a problem of collective action
and this is a very good news , because it turns out that we are very good at colle@@ cting collective action with digital
now there &apos;s a big community of people who are making the tools that we need to put things together in order to put
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america &quot; ro@@ lo@@ ws , there are hundreds of people across the country who are standing there writing government app@@ lies , every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
they &apos;re terri@@ fied with it , but they don &apos;t com@@ pla@@ in about it , they fix them . . .
and these guys know what we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
and that is , if you all look at your sen@@ ses about politics and the sna@@ ke in the work@@ line and all those other things we really exc@@ use are the government , at the core of tim , in the words of tim , on ri@@ l@@ ly , &quot; what we do , we can &apos;t do it alone . &quot;
now , a lot of people have given up the government .
and if you &apos;re one person , please i want you to think about it , because things change . things change
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is change .
and because the government ultimately per@@ forms its power from us -- remember , you &apos;re thinking , &quot; we &apos;ll be the people ? &quot; -- as we think about it , things are
i didn &apos;t know very much about the government than i started this program .
and how many people , i thought , was main@@ ly about the government , people in the order of choo@@
now , two years after , i came to the conclu@@ sion that most of the time in community communities are actually about to be the
that &apos;s the call center for the service and information center .
they typically come out when you go to the 3@@ 11 phone &apos;@@ clock . .
if you ever have the opportunity to work in your city tomorrow center , as our fellow scot@@ t sil@@ ver , as part of the program -- in fact , do you do that -- you &apos;ll see that the people who call government for many different problems , including a fact that a mar@@ g@@ in in your house is in your house .
so scot@@ t gets this stimul@@ ated .
it and &apos;s he called doesn &quot; &apos;t th@@ really under@@ know s an &quot; idea
in . the he offi@@ &apos;s cial starting dat@@ with ab@@ the ase animal . &apos;s
and finally he says , &quot; look , can you open all the do@@ ors in your house and see if the li@@ ve@@ stock is ab@@ ash@@ ing ? &quot; li@@ ve@@ stock
and that worked . for appl@@ ying scot@@ t . .
but that was not the end of the th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ines .
but boston hasn &apos;t just got a call center .
it has an ap@@ p , a web and hand ap@@ p , called &quot; citizens . &quot;
we didn &apos;t write these ap@@ p . .
this is a very smart people in the new urban mechan@@ ics in boston . in boston . in
one day -- this is an actual record -- this is a real report -- &quot; th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ines in my g@@ arb@@ age g@@ arb@@ age . cannot i say whether
how do i get it away ? &quot; ?
but what happened to &quot; citizens have come . &quot;
scot@@ t was a man &apos;s man . man
but citizens are public policy all the way on , so everybody can see it
and in this case , it saw a neighb@@ or .
and the next post that we got was , &quot; i went over there , i went over there , found the g@@ arb@@ age bur@@
th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ines ? yes . live alive ? y@@ ops
turned the land@@ ton on the page . went home .
good night , swe@@ et th@@ yl@@ ts . &quot;
pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . this is the physical . here is where the
and it &apos;s also a good example of how to get government into the crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing .
but and it i &apos;s don also &apos;t a necessarily great mean example that
of there government &apos;s as a a technical platform definition . of the
i &apos;m talking to you more than a platform for people , to help themselves and to help
a citi@@ zen ser@@ ved to make a different citi@@ zen , but the government was playing a
they co-@@ link these two people .
and you could be able to get it off to government level , if they had adop@@ ted it , but an advantage is a far better and che@@ aper alternative to
when let an &apos;s ad@@ call vent the to animal the star@@ other ster
is , the it other costs to a de@@ lot f@@ of end money
one of the most important things is we have to think about this , that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand this but they believe that one is the input of the other . .
that our contribu@@ tion to the system is the vote . .
how many times do we cho@@ se a political leader -- and sometimes we used a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we le@@ an back and we expect the government to refle@@ ct our values and ful@@ fil@@ l@@ ment our needs , and then not have a
that &apos;s because the government is like an emerging ocean and politics is the top 15 in@@ ches . in 15
and what &apos;s below is what we call bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy . .
and we use this word with such de@@ vel@@ ation .
but it &apos;s this temp@@ t that this sort of thing we own and for that we pay for us to be something different for us , and then we made ourselves . . . . .
people seem to think , politics is sex@@ y .
if we want this institution to work for us , we need to do bu@@ re@@ au@@ hi@@ d . . . .
because we that need &apos;s to where have the the govern@@ government
ance &apos;s budget machine is . happening . .
so the ac@@ compan@@ i@@ at@@ is movement has done it .
did you see these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of trou@@ ble@@ -@@ raised citizens written a very deta@@ iled 3@@ 25@@ -@@ page report , which is an answer to the se@@ c mem@@ o . a legal re@@ form on the national re@@
this is not political activity , that &apos;s bu@@ re@@ tic . active . . .
well , for those of us who have given the government , it &apos;s time we want to think about the world that we want to leave our children . .
you have to imagine the grand challenges that you have to ask . .
do we really believe that we can get what we need to achieve without having an institution that can act in the name of all of us ? ? ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it has to become more efficient . . .
the good news is that technology makes possible to suggest the function of government in a way that can actually achieve something by getting the society . . . .
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up with the internet , and knowing that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you have to create the only systems that are just right . systems .
now the average age of our ad@@ ver@@ sar@@ ies is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost one generation older than most of you . . than most
this is a generation that has grown up to see her voice for gran@@ ted . .
they &apos;re not fighting this battle that we &apos;re all fighting , which is , who can talk ; they all agree .
you can make your mind , at every time , and you can do it . in every
so if you &apos;re con@@ fron@@ ted with the problem of government , not so much about using your voices . .
they use their hands . .
they use their hands , writing appli@@ cations , which are impro@@ ving government &apos;s work
and that app@@ s will take us to use our hands to improve our communities .
it might be , to h@@ unt a hy@@ dr@@ ant , h@@ ous@@ ing a tr@@ un@@ k with a bo@@ w . a bo@@ w . a bo@@ w .
and sure , if we could have all this hy@@ dr@@ ant out all the time , and many people do this . a
but these app@@ s are like little digital memor@@ ies that we are not only consum@@ ers , and we are not only government leaders who pay ta@@ xes and recei@@ ve services . enough . .
we &apos;re more than that , we are citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve government until we &apos;re getting government citi@@ zen@@ ship
so the question i have here for all of you here : if it &apos;s about the big , important things we need to do together , we &apos;re going to be just a set of voices , or are we going to be a lot of hands ? , we &apos;re going to be
thank you .
what i do normally is to explain people about how wonderful the new technologies that are coming out of the rise are going to be , and i thought , since i &apos;m here under my friends , i would tell you what i really think . and also look back and understand what is really about , with these incredible jum@@ ps forward , which is going to happen so quickly that we can har@@ dly be able to miss . .
i &apos;m going to start by showing you one , bor@@ ing slide . . .
so , you could just show the slide for a moment . . .
this is a slide i used to be picked out of my fol@@ der .
it &apos;s not me the details of the slide , but actually , about the standard form . . . .
this slide is showing data from an analysis of the re@@ al-@@ limit@@ or of the re@@ ference of the land networks compared to the power of a tree networks .
and the interesting thing is that this slide , like this man@@ kind other , we &apos;re often meeting in our field , a kind of just on a se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g cur@@ ve . . in
in other words , each step here is a poten@@ tom@@ -@@ scale material in the performance .
and this is a new reality that we need to use this guy scale up the se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ ari@@
something very strange is happening here . here
this is essentially what i &apos;m going to talk about here . .
so , if you could turn the light again .
another more b@@ old because i &apos;m going to draw on the paper a little bit . here . .
now why do we draw gra@@ des in technology on se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic cur@@
and the reason for that is that if i were drawing it on a normal cur@@ ve , let &apos;s say this is the years , so the ti@@ mel@@ ine of a way , and this is a random measure of technology that i want to tell you with a graph , then the graph will
you see that . . .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us a lot .
now , if i want to record another technology , let &apos;s say a transpor@@ tation technology , then that would be very un@@ reas@@ on@@ able to the se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic scale , which is very un@@
but if something like this is happening , it changes quality conditions . changes .
so if the transpor@@ tation technology would continue as fast as the micro@@ process@@ or technology , we could go over@@ night into a ca@@ b and in 30 seconds we would be in to@@ k@@ yo . in to@@ k@@ yo .
but that &apos;s not that fast .
it has never been before in the history of technology , this kind of re@@ cur@@ sion@@ ur@@ er growth , which incre@@ ases exponenti@@ ally all of these years exponenti@@ ally . .
the question i want to ask you now is , if you look at these exponenti@@ al cur@@ ves , you &apos;re not going to go on and on
it &apos;s not possible that everything will be evol@@ ving and forever , as
there are two ways . . .
either it &apos;s going to be a classi@@ c sy@@ ev@@ i@@ ve like this , until something completely new from it , or it &apos;s going to happen here . . .
that &apos;s it . . .
now , i &apos;m an opti@@ m@@ ist , so i think something like this is going to happen in the way that i
so , is this really like , you know , we &apos;re in a process right now . .
we so &apos;re the here question on i this &apos;m line asking , , in and a also way i of &apos;ve getting got past myself the myself
world , &apos;s is se@@ this as new to world a going new to kind be of like world ? . ? a new this
what is this new state of state that takes the world slowly ?
because the transition seems very , very conf@@ using , if you &apos;re in the middle of it .
and when i was a kid , there was a place in 2000 , and people would talk a lot about what would happen in 2000 year 2000 . . .
now , here &apos;s a conference here , where people talk about the future , and you realize the future is still about 2000 . in 2000
we &apos;re not going to go beyond that . .
so in other words , the future is s@@ hr@@ in@@ ged by every year i am in the world since i am .
i think the reason for that is that we realize that anything is happening . .
the transition is happening . we can feel it all .
and we know it &apos;s just not a sense of trying to look at 30 or 50 years into the future , because it &apos;s going to be so different that a simple time sequence of what we &apos;re doing now , it makes sense to make sense
i want to talk to you now what that might be like , that transition that we &apos;re in right now . . .
i &apos;m going to talk first about a couple of other things that really don &apos;t have nothing to do with technology or computers . . .
because i think understanding this really is , we need to step back and look at the thing on a longer scale . .
and that &apos;s what i want to look at in the sc@@ ales of life of the earth . . .
i think the big picture gives sense to a moment when you divi@@ de it into a few more steps .
so let &apos;s go back , and that &apos;s nine and a half billion years ago , and the earth was a big , ster@@ i@@ le stone pen with a lot of the chemicals that were flo@@
now , if you look at the way these chemicals were organized , then it gives us a pretty good picture about how they did it .
i also believe there are theor@@ ies that are starting to understand like anything started with r@@ na , but i &apos;m going to give you a simpli@@ stic story of what &apos;s said that at that time , little oil dro@@ ple@@ ts had gather@@ ed around in the same ways that they &apos;ve come from . oil sp@@ ill , which had different
some of these oil ta@@ gs had a special combin@@ ation of chemicals that allowed them to in@@ corpo@@ rate other chemicals from outside and to grow . . . . .
they were all so , they came up . . . .
these little oil dri@@ ves were the primi@@ tive cell form . . . . . .
but , in fact , these oil dri@@ ves are not life@@ -@@ fil@@ ling in the real@@ m of the behavior , because every single one of them was only a small
and each time it divi@@ ded , it &apos;s en@@ ab@@ led chemicals to be dis@@ connected . . .
so every fl@@ ush , a little different . .
in fact , the dro@@ ple@@ t which had one for the growth of the infrastructure was faster than others and integr@@ ated more and more chemicals and more chemicals were getting out of numbers and divi@@ ded quickly . .
so this tenden@@ cy to survive longer and they increas@@ ed it in larger
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting it will be when these dri@@ p pe@@ ak@@ y learned a trick about abstra@@ ction .
in they some learned ways to we store haven the &apos;t re@@ quite po@@ yet und understood of , the these cell dro@@ as
ple@@ information ts , learn and to in sub@@ a scri@@ particular be chemical information form . , we . call dna
in other words , they &apos;ve found a way to kind of find a way to re@@ f@@ use a way to give them de@@ di@@ cated to what they stood on , so that this information could be stor@@ ed and cop@@ i@@ ed .
the amazing thing is that this kind of information stor@@ es over time by 2.@@ 5 billion years , where it came from , right ? sta@@ yed
in fact , the reci@@ pe represents us , which is our genes , from the ex@@ act same code and the same sym@@
and each of those beings is the ex@@ act same thing and the same code . . . .
we &apos;re so far that , only for the pleasure of being able to write ourselves , even for the pleasure of this code . . .
and i &apos;ve got 100 micro@@ gra@@ m of a white pul@@ se , which i try to keep out in air@@ por@@ ts from security intervie@@ wers . trying to keep
in this area there -- what i &apos;ve done is i took this code -- the code is made of regular letters , which we use to symbo@@ li@@ ze , and i wrote my business card on a piece of dna , and i wrote it 10 ^ 22 .
so , if a hundred million cop@@ ies of my business card , i &apos;m paying enough to everybody in this room , and even for everybody in this world , and it &apos;s right here . here . in the
if i had actually been an e@@ go@@ ma , i would have written it on a virus , and i would rele@@ ase it .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the sub@@ si@@ di@@ ous one was an interesting step
and this was what these cells did -- that made them happy for another billion years
but then another thing happened , very interesting step , where things were completely different , and so these cells began to communicate and exchange information so that communities evolved from cells . that &apos;s where
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually d@@ ele@@ te their
and this is why you &apos;re growing the dur@@ as@@ is to antibio@@ tics .
some bacteria have figured out how to keep from pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin and have this information put together with other bacteria into the dna , and now we &apos;ve got pl@@ ent@@ y of bacteria that are resi@@ stant to pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin because the bacteria communicate together .
now , this communication was allowed to do this set of communities that were in a certain sense , but they were sy@@ ner@@ ver@@ tics . .
so now they the either transi@@ survive tional together space , is or where they these would communities go are together so , close and together that that meant they that decided if to a write community the was
reci@@ successful pe , for all the individuals whole of community the into community a were sign repe@@ chain at@@ . ed@@ ly . repe@@ ated . , and . from evolution . .
and the next interesting period took about another billion years . about another billion years .
at this point , we have multi-@@ multi-@@ multi-@@ multi-@@ cell@@ ular communities , communities of many different cell sub@@ t@@ als , which operate together as single organis@@ m
indeed , we &apos;re also such a multi-@@ multi-@@ multi-@@ community community .
we have many cells that are no longer determin@@ ed by themselves .
your skin cells are us@@ eless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on . . .
so these communities were evol@@ ving , so that the level of evolution was no longer the single cell , but the entire cell community that we call organis@@ m . . .
the next step was going into this community . .
the cell communities started to abstra@@ ct information . . .
and they developed specifically speci@@ alized structures that did nothing else than process information within the organis@@ m
and these are the neu@@ ral structures .
so the neurons are information process@@ ed , which these cell communities have built . . .
they started training speci@@ alists in the community , specifically structures , which were responsible for learning and understanding and building information . data . .
and this was the brain , and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage . .
because at that point , an individual -- learning happened within a period of life , rather than that evolutionary ti@@ mel@@ ess of a single organis@@ m , instead of through
so an organis@@ m could learn , for example , not eating a certain fru@@ it because it was fre@@ ely ta@@ sted and made it sick , the last time he e@@ aten them
now , this could be done inside the lifetime of a single organis@@ m , whereas by hundreds of thousands of years , it had to be learned because this information of evolutionary technology has to be learned from the individuals that died because of these fru@@ it , because these information process@@
so the nervous system has this particular process of information process@@ ing , because evolution has now been around to an individual . .
it could be taken in a ti@@ me@@ -@@ like
what happened next is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate in each other . .
for example , as an example , the most sophisticated ones of this communication type is the human
but it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention that you think about it .
i have a very complicated , in@@ struc@@ tional and conf@@ used idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here , and i &apos;m basically giving gr@@ u@@ tt@@ ing notes of me , hop@@ ing to create a similar idea with your original idea , which has some simil@@ ar@@ ity to
so we take something very complicated , transform it in sound , a sequence of sound , and then we produce something very complicated in the minds of
so this allows us to do as a one-@@ way organis@@ m . . . .
and what we did , we , the human@@ kind , is we &apos;ve got abstra@@ ct . abstra@@ ct .
we &apos;re going through the same st@@ ages , which have been through multiple cell organisms -- the abstra@@ ction of our metho@@ ds , how we present data , process . .
for example , the invention of language was a little step in that direction . .
tele@@ ph@@ ony , computers , video details , c@@ d-@@ ro@@ ms , and so on , all the speci@@ alized mechanis@@ ms that we built in our community to have that information . . .
and it combin@@ es us all together to do something much bigger , and also be able to evol@@ ve faster than we &apos;ve been . .
so today , evolution can happen in the time time of micro@@ seconds .
you &apos;ve seen also &quot; ys a little evolutionary example , where he has showed a little bit of evolution in the con@@ vol@@ ing program , right in your
so now we &apos;ve rele@@ ased the sc@@ ales . . .
the first steps in history that i told you , that a billion years left . . .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , for several hundred million years .
then the next few steps , like language and so forth , less than a million years .
and those next steps , as electr@@ on@@ ics , are just a few decades to take . .
the process is fe@@ eding by itself and becomes , i think , car cat@@ aly@@ st is the word for -- if something is en@@ am@@ em@@ ed by its change .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explosion of explo@@ sions . .
we see the process that fe@@ e@@ ds from itself .
i live in a professional way of making computers , and i know that i could use the mechan@@ ism that i use to build computers , without the ex@@ pos@@ ure
my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible to design them in the traditional sense of design . . .
i don &apos;t know what any transi@@ st@@ or in the machine machine does .
it has billions of those .
what i do , and whatever the designers of thinking use , is we think of a certain abstra@@ ct , over@@ -@@ a-@@ min@@ d@@ y-@@ type , which is that this machine and machine makes it something to ex@@ ce@@ ute our ability to dep@@ end better and faster than we ever
and it makes it par@@ tly with metho@@ ds that we don &apos;t really understand . . .
one way that &apos;s particularly interesting , and what i &apos;ve been using recently is evolution itself . .
and in this inst@@ ant , we inst@@ all an evolutionary process in the machine that is happening in the micro@@ sea area .
to give an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that &apos;s evolved from random in@@ struc@@ tions . . .
we say , &quot; computers , com@@ ics , please , can be picked up a hundred million by in@@ struc@@
now , i &apos;m going to ask all of these random in@@ struc@@ tions , leaders all the time , and then take all the stuff that i have on my trial . &quot; . &quot; &quot; to
so in other words , i &apos;m going to start doing what
let &apos;s say i want to make nu@@ cle@@ s , that would be a simple example of which i
so , there are programs that can be the most of all numbers of the
of course , if you have a chance to in@@ struc@@ ti@@ ate , in@@ struc@@ tions are very small , they &apos;re not making numbers of numbers ,
but one of them may have a little bit lucky to re@@ je@@ ct two numbers into the right
now i say , &quot; computers , take the 10 percent of the sequ@@ ences , which are the next one that i have left my research
store those down , fire the rest .
now , the rest of the rema@@ ining , the number of rema@@ ins that are
and with a method of re@@ com@@ bine , anal@@ o@@ g to re@@ production . &quot; . &quot;
take two challenges , and they produce kids through the exchange of their su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ es , and the kids are missing the fe@@ atures of the su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ es from the two programs .
so now i have a new generation of programs that came out of combin@@ ations of software , which have come to a little bit closer to the
tell me , &quot; please repe@@ at this process . &quot;
keep them back . .
show some mu@@ tations . .
and try and try this one again to another generation .
all these generations require just a few milli@@ seconds . needs to take
and so i can spend evolution over millions of years in the computer in just a few minutes or more complex cases . , for some hours . . .
and finally , i do programs that make nu@@ cle@@ ous numbers perfectly . . . .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could ever written from hand . .
if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how to work . .
i tried to understand them . . . . .
they &apos;re more trou@@ bled and od@@ d programs .
but they do the job .
i know and i &apos;m sure you &apos;re doing the job doing this because you come from a series of thousands of programs that got the job done . . . .
because their lives depen@@ ded on whether they did the job right .
i was once in a 7@@ 4@@ 7 meeting with mar@@ v@@ in min@@ sky , he &apos;s got a map , and he says , &quot; oh look . look at that . &quot;
and that &apos;s where there is a hundred thousand pieces of small@@ -@@ and-@@ thousands of pieces of work that are working together to make your flight se@@ cure . &apos; makes you not
we know that a process of development doesn &apos;t have the opti@@ mal sense of being too complicated .
so let &apos;s start off on computers , for a process that &apos;s very dist@@ ingu@@ ished by the classi@@ c
it allows us to do things with a much more complicated value than the normal metho@@ ds of
and yet we don &apos;t understand the cap@@ ability yet . . .
so , in a way , the technology is going to tell us
we now use these programs to do much faster so that we can make this processes even faster . . . .
so it creates a feedback . . .
it &apos;s going to be faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems so
because all of these new technologies are fe@@ eding themselves from themselves .
we &apos;re going to raise .
we &apos;re at a point of time that anal@@ o@@ g is to have a multi-@@ cell organisms developed multiple cell organisms . . . . .
so we &apos;re the am@@ e@@ mi@@ ans , and we can &apos;t quite easily see what the hell we &apos;re actually about to do .
we &apos;re in the middle of that transi@@ tional point
but i really do believe that after us , there is something else .
i find it very ti@@ g@@ ently to say that we are the final product of evolution . . .
and i think we all agree here in the part of creation of what is next . .
now , lunch is before , and i think i &apos;m listening now , before i get out of here . . .
my story starts right here in ra@@ j@@ as@@ than , about two years ago .
i was under the star@@ k of the desert with su@@ fi sing@@ ers in the middle of the desert with su@@ k@@ i . al@@ i
we talked about nothing has changed since the time of ancient indian e@@ po@@ s , &quot; ma@@ hab@@ har@@ at@@ a . &quot; . &quot; .
if we wanted to travel in the back of the time , we went into a car and we scre@@ w over the sky . . a c@@ rest
now we &apos;re doing this with air@@ planes .
at the time , when the great indian war@@ ri@@ or had ar@@ med , he took a bo@@ wed , shot in the floor and drin@@ king it . . a hole . a hole . water . .
now we &apos;re doing this with dri@@ vers and machines . .
we came to the conclu@@ sion that the magic and magic were placed by machines . .
that i made got me some sad sc@@ . ared of . technology
. . . . . . . .
it was terri@@ bly fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing that i could lose the ability to have the sun@@ set without the c@@ ash without any t@@ we@@ et to my friends . . . .
i thought technology should make a possible thing , and not killing that .
when i was a little girl , my grand@@ father gave me his little sil@@ ver po@@ cket watch .
this piece of 50 years old , the most magic thing for me was the most magic thing
it became a gold rus@@ h to get a world of pi@@ pes and un@@ happy ships and to pictures in my imagination . . .
it seemed like our off@@ sh@@ ore and our off@@ spring would dream of it . like we started to dream . .
they were inspired by us to be inspired
and so i went to the world of technology to see how i could use them , to make a magic , rather than killing . . . . .
and at 16 , i started to illu@@ strate books . .
when i saw the i@@ pad , i saw it as a device to tell the story@@ t@@ le@@ on that can connect the re@@ a@@ der on the
it can know how to do it . how
it can know where we are .
it &apos;s taking pictures and words together , anima@@ tion and spo@@ k@@ es@@ ness
the story@@ telling takes it all the way . .
but what do we do about that ?
now i &apos;m going to go and do a little bit of k@@ ho@@ ya , an inter@@ active i@@ pad . . .
here &apos;s &quot; throw your finger on your light . &quot; . .
and so -- here it is : &quot; this box bel@@ on@@ gs , &quot; i write my name . . .
and i &apos;m going to get a character in the book
and then again , a letter to me down -- and the i@@ pad knows by gps , where i live -- it &apos;s really true to me . in add@@ res@@ sing
and i &apos;m really excited about this kid in me . .
i talked a lot about magic . . .
i don &apos;t mean magic and dra@@ g@@ ons , but the magic of the career , the ideas that we all had as children . . . ideas that we
fire@@ flies in a glass , i always found quite exciting . . glo@@ wing . glo@@ w .
so you have to ski@@ p the i@@ pad and let the light flies make out . .
and the ligh@@ ting is the way through the rest of the book . .
another idea that fascin@@ ated me as a child is that it can put a whole galaxy in a single comp@@ ass . . .
and therefore every book will become a small fa@@ ke , and every world , a small fa@@ ke , which i &apos;m going to sing here to the magic
and that op@@ ens a map . .
fan@@ t@@ asy had already maps , but these cards were sta@@ tic . . . .
this map is growing and glo@@ ws and uses to gui@@ de the rest of the book . . .
it also shows other forms of the book . . . .
i &apos;m in here . . .
it &apos;s also important to me to make something that in@@ san@@ e is also very ti@@ ined . .
these are the ap@@ sar@@ as . . .
we &apos;ve heard of fe@@ es and n@@ y@@ p@@ es , but how many people outside of india are familiar their indian colleagues , the ap@@ ne@@ ak@@ as ? ? that the ap@@ sh@@ as ?
the poor ap@@ sar@@ as had been caught thousands of years in in@@ dr@@ as &apos;s be@@ ats in an old book . . . .
and we take them back , in a con@@ temporary history for children . .
a story that comes along with new issues , like the environmental crisis . .
in the theme of environmental crisis , a big problem of the last 10 years is that kids are sitting in their rooms , no way to go out on their computers , no way to go out . . . . .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our kids into the natural world with their technology . .
in an interaction of the book , you &apos;re being sent to a search . you &apos;ve got to go out and collect the camera &apos;s pictures of natural objects . . . . . .
i was a child when i was a kid in high tal@@ es , st@@ ones , ki@@ d@@ bling and sh@@ ells .
and so , the children don &apos;t make it .
this is a childhood ritual re@@ stor@@ ed , you have to go out to make a photograph of a flo@@ wer , and to do it . . .
in another chap@@ ter , you have to do a piece of sc@@ mr@@ i photograph@@ y and tag . .
so you can actually put a digital colle@@ ction of photographs that you can put online online . . .
a child in london shows the picture of a set and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a qu@@ eu@@ e of this . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen an ap@@ ter@@ y . &quot;
and that creates a kind of social network around a digital colle@@ ction of photographs that you &apos;ve actually taken .
and so there &apos;s a variety of opportunities to be ma@@ gical , and conne@@ cting the world and technology
in the next book , we &apos;re doing an interaction where you use the i@@ pa@@ ds video and you can see it by aug@@ mented reality a anima@@ tion that appe@@ ars to appear in front of the house . a plant from the front of the house
one place , the screen fil@@ ls with leaves . .
you have to make the sound of the wind , you have to fly away and read the rest of the bay .
we all move towards a world where the forces of technology are coming closer to the em@@ ul@@ ate technology and can be able to approach technology . . . .
we use the energy of the sun . . .
we bring our kids closer and closer to the natural world , and we &apos;re going to get into the magic , and fun and love of our childhood through the simple
thank you .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me . .
i spend most of my time with people in research , pris@@ ons or death cells . .
i spend most of my time with the so@@ cially we@@ ak@@ est in social construction sett@@ ings and places that there &apos;s a lot of hope .
being here at ted , watching and hearing how stimul@@ ating this is , has given me a lot of strength . a lot
in the short time here , i was clear to me : this is what &apos;s done here . has an
you can say things that have influence in the world . . . .
and sometimes , when something comes to ted , it makes a signifi@@ can@@ ce and a force that otherwise would not have .
i say that because i think that identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic pres@@ ent@@ ations . .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher have meaning , but that &apos;s particularly meaning@@ ful to a more common teacher . . . . . . .
as a doctor , you can do good . as a care@@ ful doctor , but you can do more . than that . care .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn that in my work as a law@@ yer . . . .
i learned this from my grandmother . .
i got high in a family , a traditional afri@@ can@@ ra@@ tic house@@ hold , which was domin@@ ated by a matri@@ ar@@ ch , and this matri@@ ar@@ ch was my
she was a pi@@ vo@@ on , strong woman , she had an
she had the last word in every family . .
she was also the starting point of a lot of conflict in our family .
she was a sla@@ ve family daughter . . . .
their parents were born in virg@@ ini@@ a in the 18@@ 4@@ 0s as a sla@@ very .
she was born in 18@@ 80 , and the experience of sla@@ very formed her world@@ life very hea@@ vi@@ ly . . a
my grandmother was strong , but she was also lo@@ ving . .
when so i i met felt them so as stron@@ a g@@ young ly boy that , i she could came bar@@ up ely to brea@@
me the and , hu@@ and g@@ then ged she me would . let me . go . . . .
one or two hours later , when i met her , she came up to me and she said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , do you feel my embra@@ ce ? &quot; ? ? my um@@
and when i said no to , they hu@@ g@@ ged me back . if i said , &quot; yes , she &apos;d let me go . . . .
she was something that was made you want to be near you . .
the only problem with this was that they had 10 children .
my mom was the yo@@ un@@ gest of her young children .
sometimes when i spent time with their time , it was hard to get their attention . enough . . .
my cous@@ in would walk around everywhere . .
i remember , i &apos;ve got to have been eight or nine , and i wo@@ ke up in the room one morning and went around in the living room all my cous@@ ins were going .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the room and star@@ ing at
first , i thought that this would be a game .
i saw her and s@@ mil@@ ed , but she looked very serious . . .
and that was 15 or 20 minutes , and then she stood up and she came over to me . she took me on my hand and said , &quot; come , go br@@ y@@ an . you and i , we have to talk . &quot; &apos;@@ y@@
i remember just being there , like it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
she took me outside , and she said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise you won &apos;t be talking . &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m sorry . &quot;
she said , &quot; hon@@ ey word ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot; . . .
she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know that i saw you &apos;ve seen me . &quot; .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that .
then she said , &quot; only you have to promise me three things , br@@ y@@ an . &quot; .
i said , &quot; okay , om@@ a . &quot;
she said , &quot; the first thing i &apos;m going to leave you is that you &apos;re going to be happy . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom@@ ma is , and you have to promise that you &apos;re always going to take care of you . &quot;
i gave my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , i &apos;m actually , you know , i &apos;m going to do
then she said , &quot; what next i am to do is you &apos;ll always do the right thing . &quot; even if it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot; .
i thought , &quot; yeah , ma . i promise . &quot; , i promise . &quot; , i
finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise to me is &quot; you &apos;re never going to drink al@@ co@@ hol .
well , i was nine years old , and so i said , &quot; yes , grandmother . i promise . &quot;
i grew up in the country , in the old , rural south , and i have a brother who &apos;s older and a year yo@@ unger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 years old , my brother came home one day , and brought me home , and i got to see a se@@ ed be@@ er with a s@@ nap@@ ging , my sister and i went to the forest . . .
we are only around the way or so . . . . .
and he took a beat be@@ er and off@@ ered my sister &apos;s friend , and she as@@ sum@@ ed , and then they call me one . one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . right . do you do it . i don &apos;t want a be@@ er . &quot; . &quot; .
my brother said , &quot; well , you go ahead . now , we do that , you know , you &apos;re
i had something , your sister had what , she had a be@@ er .
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to . don &apos;t you just do it . &quot; . &quot; . &quot; . &quot;
my brother star@@ ed at me . . star@@
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? now , what do you do
and then he saw me in the face and said , &quot; oh no , you &apos;re not going to make you crazy about the conversation with grandmother ? &quot; ,
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot; what ?
he said , &quot; om@@ a tells us all grand@@ math that they are special . &quot; .
i was de@@ va@@ st@@ ated .
i i &apos;m probably going should to not get do you that to
. something . . . . . .
this is probably going to trans@@ fer public . .
i &apos;m 5@@ 2 years old , and i &apos;m standing there , i &apos;ve never dro@@ pped a drop of al@@ co@@ hol . . .
i &apos;m not saying this because i think it &apos;s virtu@@ e . i say that because of identity means that it means that
if we can create the right kind of identity , we can tell people around us , they &apos;re not thinking of things that they &apos;re starting to
we can get them to do things that they thought they could . . .
of course , my grandmother would tell all of her grand@@ children , she &apos;s special . .
my my grand@@ un@@ father cle was died in up prison to during al@@
the co@@ pro@@ hol hi@@ industrial bi@@ disease tion . in prison .
and she believed that this was the subje@@ cts we needed to take care of
i &apos;ve tried to say something about our law system . . .
this land is different from 40 years ago . . .
in 197@@ 2 , 30@@ 0,000 people were in pa@@ yo@@ ff and in prison .
today it &apos;s 2.@@ 3 million . today
the united states today has the highest in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation rate in the world today .
seven million people are dis@@ gu@@ is@@ ed , or by the opposite crimin@@
in my view , mass in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation is fundament@@ ally changing our world . . .
in so@@ cially dis@@ gu@@ king and black parts of the population are des@@ per@@ ation and hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness , because of these changes . . . .
one in three to 30 , in a lot of the old , in a prison , dis@@ count , left in cur@@ ren@@ cy , or by any other
in urban communities all over the country -- from los angeles phil@@ ad@@ el@@ phi@@ a , bal@@ ti@@ more to washington -- 50 to 60 percent of black young men are either in great , in prison , dis@@ par@@ ate , or dis@@ placed with other
but it &apos;s not just a question of questions that have to do with race , it &apos;s also created by poverty . . . gener@@ ated .
we have a law system in this country that they treat a lot better if they &apos;re rich and inno@@ cent than poor and inno@@ cent . . . .
wealth , not de@@ bt , affec@@ ts the result .
but we still seem to be satis@@ fied with it .
a policy of fear and an@@ ger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems . . .
we &apos;ve lost the touch .
i find that interesting . .
there are some interesting develop@@ ments . . . .
my home al@@ ab@@ ama is constantly dra@@ g@@ ging her vote when sent@@ en@@ cing pre@@ ci@@ pit@@ ation . . . . . . .
and here , in al@@ ab@@ ama , 3@@ 4 percent of the male world population has perman@@ ently lost their symptom@@ s .
we predict that in 10 years , the rate of the en@@ vision of the global liber@@ ty rights is going to be as big as the ele@@ ction of the ele@@ ction act . . a pre@@ mis@@
the sil@@ ence is o@@ partment . .
i give you a little
a lot of my cli@@ ents are very young .
the united states of america is the only country in the world , con@@ vi@@ cted of 3@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds
in this country there is no more dis@@ mal ir@@ on of life without any in@@ fer@@ i@@
we &apos;ve already run a lot of technology . .
the only country in the world .
i give people a death cells .
the death pen@@ al@@ ty question is an interesting question . .
we think , because you &apos;ve taught us that the real question is : did a human deser@@ ve to die for one of them ? an object ? a
this is a very sensitive question . .
but you can also think about how we &apos;re going to see our identity .
the other view is not : does anybody make a death for a crime , but is , do we deser@@ ve to kill ? ? to kill ? ?
i find that fascinating . .
the death pen@@ al@@ ty is defined by ir@@ rever@@ ence .
nine people we &apos;ve ex@@ ecu@@ ted , comes from one that we &apos;ve been ex@@ ecu@@ ted for inno@@ cent , which has been de@@ vot@@ ed and dis@@ ab@@ led from death .
an amazing er@@ ror rate : one of nine inno@@ cent . . . .
i find that fascinating . .
we would never let anybody fly with an airplane if nine planes that go out , a drop . . . . .
but somehow we can make it up , and we can scale
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our tru@@ de .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
i talk a lot about these questions .
i talk about race and the question of whether we are right to kill .
and i it talk &apos;s about exciting terror@@ because ism i , teach the my time students at af@@ the ro@@ end american of history the
. world i world talk , about to sla@@ world very war . ii . sla@@ very . . . sla@@
we don &apos;t really know very much about that .
but for afri@@ can@@ -@@ american , it was a period of ter@@ ror . .
in many areas , people had to fear of ly@@ n@@ gos . .
or bom@@ bs . bom@@ bs . .
it was the fear of ter@@ ror , who formed her life .
these el@@ der@@ ly people are coming to me now and they say , &quot; m@@ r , ste@@ ven@@ son , they &apos;re talking , they &apos;re going to stop making it . they &apos;re saying to people that they need to stop saying that we need to stop doing it for the first time
they say , &quot; no -- tell the people that we grew up with this . &quot; .
and after terror@@ ism , of course , after terror@@ ism , of course , they motiv@@ ated the ra@@ p@@ ge and decades of pre@@ ten@@ ding sub@@ mission and
and yet , in our country , there is a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like talking about our problems . .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand the impact of our actions in the histor@@ ic context . . .
we &apos;re constantly eng@@ aging each other .
we create new pr@@ on@@ o@@ un@@ ces and conflict .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we don &apos;t want to get rid of the process of truth and re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation . .
in south africa , people understand that the h@@ ills are not over@@ head , without the will@@ ing@@ ness to truth and re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
even after the geno@@ cide in r@@ wand@@ a , there was this will@@ ing@@ ness , but not in that country . . .
i &apos;ve been giving a couple of talks in germany about the death pen@@ al@@ ty
it was fascinating because one of the scientists who was at my talk was going up and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply dist@@ ur@@ bing , you hear this talk . &quot; &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there is no death pen@@ al@@ ty . .
and of course , she can never be able to pass it in germany . &quot; .
it was completely sil@@ ent . then a woman said , &quot; with our history , &quot; with our history it &apos;s impossible that we will ever kill ourselves to be more syste@@ matic people in humans
it would be used by us , consci@@ ously and by people . &quot; . &quot; . &quot; . &quot; . &quot; . .
i was thinking about it .
what it would feel like to be in a world where ger@@ man state was going to people , especially if they were un@@ propor@@ tion@@ ally many je@@ ws . , if they
it it would would be be in@@ used toler@@
. able . . . .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the old south , we &apos;re moving people -- here &apos;s the risk of becoming dea@@ ths , to death , if the sac@@ red is white , if the sac@@ red is white , and the vic@@ tim knows -- in the same state , the body knows the body , the poor people sh@@ red people . in the state of the state , the soli@@ d people hi@@ de people . in the same state , where
and yet , there is this mental lin@@ ing .
i think our identity is thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed .
if we don &apos;t care with this difficult top@@ ic , the positive and wonderful things are also affected . . things .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity . .
we love enter@@ tainment .
but eventually , these reali@@ ties are over@@ wh@@ el@@ med by suffering , ab@@ use , her@@ der@@ ing , ex@@ ecu@@ tion .
it seems to me that i &apos;m going to make both of you .
because for we me &apos;re , ultimately time talking is about going that to we get need time more to hope start , thinking more and commit@@ talk ment about to the more poor and
, more the commit@@ dis@@ ment advan@@ to ta@@ a ged complex , world the . ones that . never come . to be . ted . . .
but in a way , it &apos;s considered to inte@@ gra@@ te in our own lives .
we all need to believe things that we can &apos;t see . . .
we do . so , we are rational , as much as we appreci@@ ate . as we are
innovation , creativity , and development , not just come from our heads . .
they come from ideas that are driven by the per@@ su@@ asi@@ on in our he@@ arts . . . .
it &apos;s this head@@ -@@ heart connection that i think is driving us , not just to be open to all the bright and passionate things , but also the dark and the proble@@ matic and proble@@ matic .
vac@@ cam@@ v ha@@ vel , the great ch@@ eu@@ e politi@@ cian , once said .
&quot; when we were fighting east europe against the op@@ pres@@ sion , we wanted to do everything , but what we needed most of the most was a hope , a vio@@ lin ori@@ entation , the will@@ ing@@ ness , sometimes in hop@@ eless places , and being like us . &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
this spi@@ ritual ori@@ entation is the core of what i believe is also the ted communities that have to engage for it . . .
there is no boundar@@ y around technology and design that allows us to be very human , unless we have eyes and e@@ ars for poverty , ex@@ posed to in@@ justice . . . . .
i want to war@@ n you . this kind of identity requires a lot more to us than if we weren &apos;t ro@@ bled . than if it
it &apos;s going to be deeply tou@@
i had the great privi@@ lege of meeting p@@ ink par@@ ks , i was a young privi@@ lege to meet p@@ ink
and so , par@@ ks kept coming back to mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ ery , where they &apos;re wearing two of their ol@@ dest friends , these older women , john@@ nie car@@ r , who organized the mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ ar bus bo@@ y@@ c@@ ot@@ t , and he had an incredible water@@ can@@ -@@ ai@@ t , dr. king record , a white person , cli@@ ff@@ ord dur@@ r , dr. king repres@@ entation . a du@@ ck , a husband whose husband , cli@@ ff@@
so these women were getting involved with themselves . .
and then , as a result , woman car@@ r then went to the town and said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , wife &apos;s going to the town . we want to talk . . . we want
do you want to come in and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , very much like . &quot; . .
she said , &quot; what are you going to do when you &apos;re here ? &quot; ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;ll listen . &quot; . &quot;
and i went over and i just laugh@@ ed . . . .
it was always so in@@ spir@@ ing , so bri@@ m@@ be@@ ting
one day i was sitting there and i heard this women , and after a couple of hours , a woman turned to me and said , &quot; well , you tell me what the post-@@ equ@@ ally right was . &quot; . .
what are they trying to do ? &quot; ?
i started my usual talk . . .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to do not against in@@ justice .
now , people want to help people become inno@@ cent . .
we want to fight bi@@ ases and dis@@ crimin@@ ation in the crimin@@ al justice system . . .
we want to create life in the long run of life without any in@@ fer@@ i@@
we want to do something about the death pen@@ al@@ ty . .
we we want want to to reduce make the mass number in@@ of
car@@ in@@ cer@@ mates ation . . &quot; . .
i thought i was thinking of my usual talk , and after that , she looked at me and said , &quot; oh , look . m@@ h@@ mm .
she said , &quot; it &apos;s going to do it very , very ti@@ red . &quot; . &quot;
then , in front of me , the woman , car@@ r , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and so you have to be very , very den@@ ser . &quot; . &quot; . &quot;
and so i believe the ted community should be with ta@@ d@@ der . .
we need to make ways of add@@ res@@ sing , to give us the challenges , this suffering
because ultimately , our humanity is depen@@ dent upon our humanity .
in my work , i learned very simple things . . .
i learned some very simple things . .
that we &apos;re all more than the worst thing we ever have . .
i think that &apos;s true for every human being on the
when there is a lie , it &apos;s not just a li@@ ar . .
when somebody gets something that doesn &apos;t hear it , it &apos;s not just one th@@ yl@@ or . . .
even who kill@@ s you is not just a mur@@ derer . . .
and because that &apos;s what &apos;s necessary to respect the law to respect the law . . .
i believe also , in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of the world , is not wealth . poverty . . .
i don &apos;t think so .
i think that &apos;s the opposite of poverty in many places . justice justice .
and finally , i believe that even though it &apos;s so dra@@ matic , as beautiful and in@@ spir@@ ing , and so on , we &apos;re not measu@@ red at the end of our technology , not the things we develop , not in our intelle@@ ct and mind . . . . . . .
finally , a society is not measu@@ red by how you &apos;re tre@@ ating your rich and powerful and privi@@ le@@ ged , but how you deal with the poor , the jud@@ gment , the in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation . . . .
because in this context , we begin to understand the really amazing things that make us out . . .
sometimes i get the balance . a story to end . . .
sometimes i ur@@ ge too much .
i &apos;m going to be ti@@ red of all of us .
sometimes they have these ideas , even in a very important way . ,
i &apos;ll disc@@ uss these children who were too hard in cour@@ t . . . . .
i go to prison prison and i go to an el@@ ev@@ ate who may be 13 or 14 years old , and to be an adult in cour@@ t . .
and then i wonder : how could this happen ? that
how can a ju@@ dge turn anyone into something that it &apos;s not ?
the ju@@ dge looks at him as adults , but i see a child . . a child
i had a long time , and i thought my god was , when a ju@@ dge could turn us into something else , he must have magic and ma@@ z@@ mi@@ es . . . .
right , br@@ y@@ an , ju@@ dge has a magic forces . .
you should also want to want to .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t really think anymore , i began working on a post .
i had a 14 year-old , poor young boys as an out@@ cher . . . .
and i started with this . the head@@ line was : &quot; try , my poor , 14 year-old cli@@ ents like a privi@@ le@@ ged , white , se@@ 5@@ old top of the ter@@ der@@ ly . &quot; . &quot; . &quot;
in my brief , i expla@@ ined that the contra@@ ct of the state of govern@@ ance and the police are also the police and the police and the contra@@ ct
there was no such no@@ vel@@ a line that there &apos;s no nothing in this country except there &apos;s no mista@@ kes . . .
the next morning , i wo@@ ke up and i couldn &apos;t see if i was just going to read this crazy thing just to get a breath or
and i didn &apos;t just have written it just like i was in the cour@@ t . . . .
a few months went forward , and i just had a few months . .
and eventually , i decided to do my god , i &apos;ve got to pro@@ pose in the cour@@ t and i want to offer
i got into the car , and i was really over@@ wh@@ el@@ med -- over@@ wh@@ el@@ med . over@@
so i went to the cour@@ t . . . . .
and i thought it will be so hard , so pain@@ ful . . .
and finally , i got out of my car and went up to be up . . .
when i was a dis@@ k to the cour@@ t , there was an older man , black man , jan@@ ma@@ sters at cour@@ t . . . .
and he came over to me , and he came over to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m an@@ gry . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a law@@ yer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yeah . &quot; . .
he and came he up was and wh@@ he is@@ got per@@ me ing .
to me hu@@ . g@@ ging . . a . he@@
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
and i have to say , there was power . .
it was a very deep way deep inside me , identity , the ability to contribu@@ te every single person to a community perspective of a hope perspective . perspective .
well , i was enter@@ ing the cour@@ t .
once the ju@@ dge saw me . . . a man . .
he said , &quot; mr. ste@@ ven@@ son , did you put this crazy as@@ sign@@ ment ?
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started to argue . . .
and more and more people would come in , just because they were an@@
that i had written these crazy things .
police off@@ ic@@ ers came in and bu@@ ried the state law@@ yers and bu@@ yer workers . .
it was a legal bed system of people who were an@@ gry that we talked about skin color , about poverty , about ine@@ quality . on ine@@ quality . . on ine@@ quality .
from my eye angle , i looked at the jan@@ it@@ or and down . . . . .
he kept looking through the window , and then heard the whole to@@ y of to@@ y@@ w@@ ars .
he went up and down . .
finally , this older black man with a very worried sho@@ ck into the cour@@ t in the cour@@ t room , and he sat right behind me , almost on the defen@@ se
10 minutes later , the ju@@ dge announ@@ ced a second . .
during the break , a police off@@ ic@@ er came in , the jan@@ it@@ ors were in cour@@ t . . . . .
this de@@ pu@@ ty ran over to the older black . . . . .
he said , &quot; j@@ im@@ my , what are you doing in the cour@@ t room ? &quot;
older man up there . he saw the de@@ pu@@ ty , then he saw me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve come here to tell this young man , you lose the goal , give you no eyes . &quot; . &quot; . &quot;
i &apos;ve come to the ted because i believe many of you have figured out that the moral pen@@ ta &apos;s moral pen@@ et@@ ration pen@@ et@@ rate is a whole range
that we are not completely developed as humans , as long as we &apos;re not taking care of human rights
that our entire lives of survival is lin@@ ked to every single one of our
that we have to move our visi@@ ons of technology and design , enter@@ tainment and creativity to be in human beings , compassion and justice .
and especially , i want you to be in front of you who are the same , just saying , you don &apos;t lose the goal . give &apos;t you .
they &apos;ve seen this audience , this community , and bel@@ on@@ gs to helping them do something . . . . . .
what can we do ? ? . what else
br@@ y@@ an ste@@ ven@@ son : well ,
if you live in california , there &apos;s a single fol@@ k decision where it comes to a business where it is actually a effort to do something about the amount of money that &apos;s going to be run into the politics of pun@@ ish@@ ment . .
here , in california , for example , in california , you &apos;ll have a billion dollars for death pen@@ al@@ ty , a billion dollars . a billion dollars
and yet , 4@@ 6 percent of all the tra@@ de-@@ off@@ s don &apos;t have any for@@ gi@@ ven@@
5@@ 6 percent of ra@@ ti@@ o ra@@ ti@@ o markets don &apos;t
there is a chance to do something . .
this re@@ ference is pro@@ pos@@ ing to invest the money in more of these security forces and security . .
i think there are ways everywhere . . .
during the last three decades , the dis@@ car@@ cer@@ al rate in america is living healthy .
that &apos;s a result that &apos;s often provi@@ ding into a context with increas@@ ed in@@ her@@ ent infrastructure . .
what would you tell somebody who &apos;s thinking ? ?
well , in fact , the number of violence has not changed very
most of the mass in@@ consi@@ sten@@ cies in this country found not really in the class of non@@ crime .
it was the mis@@ gui@@ ded cross ra@@ il@@ road .
so the dra@@ matic number of numbers come in the prison in@@ mates . .
we have moved out of the rhe@@ tor@@ ic of pun@@ ish@@ ment . .
now we have three ver@@ sions &apos; laws &apos; laws , which make people behind b@@ ars , for a bi@@ cycle the@@ ft , for the the@@ ft of lower good , rather than being har@@ med them to give back things to sac@@ ri@@ fi@@
i think we need to do more to help people become the vic@@ ti@@ ms of a pun@@ ish@@ ment , not less .
and i think our present ir@@ on re@@ lief secre@@ ts doesn &apos;t help anybody .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change . . .
now br@@ y@@ an , you really have a string of the vi@@ br@@ ant
they &apos;re an in@@ spir@@ ing person@@ ality .
thank you for being at ted . thank you . .
bin laden &apos;s dying is an el@@ ev@@ ated risk of a ris@@ ing risk of wa@@

oh my god . .
so these are just a couple of the cli@@ ps i &apos;ve colle@@ cted over the last six months -- but could have been the last six days . or the last six years
the fact is that the media pre@@ fer@@ red it to show us negative issues because our minds paying attention to exactly these issues . enough to
and there &apos;s a very good reason for that .
every second every day we catch our sen@@ ses much more information than our brain can ever get hurt . . .
and because of us , we &apos;re not more important than our survival , the first time for all of the information is part of our tem@@ po@@ ral lo@@ bes , the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala .
so the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala is our early war@@ ning system , our vehicle dete@@ ctor . .
it &apos;s taking and cat@@ ching all the information that &apos;s going on for any of the pres@@ sur@@ es in our surro@@
so if we look at the news , we pre@@ fer to look look at negative news . .
and the old ada@@ ge , if it flo@@ ats , the demand is very true . . .
now , with all our digital devices that have to put us seven days a week , 24 hours a day , to have all these negative news , it &apos;s not a mira@@ cle we &apos;re going to
it &apos;s not a mira@@ cle that everybody thinks it &apos;s always getting worse .
but maybe this is not the case .
possibly this is the reality . . .
perhaps , the vast amount of progress we &apos;ve done in the last century that we &apos;ve done in the last century that we &apos;ve done is so strong that we will be able to create a world of over@@ all value in the next three
well i &apos;m not saying we don &apos;t have big problems -- climate crisis , bio@@ -@@ extin@@ ct , water problems -- we &apos;ve already got . . .
and as humans , we &apos;re much better at seeing problems at a very long time , but they &apos;re finally over@@ coming . .
so , let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve achie@@ ved in the last century , so we can for@@
in the last 100 years , average life expec@@ tan@@ cy has more than dou@@ bled that trans@@ lation has increas@@ ed the average income income of the world &apos;s population has been tri@@ pl@@ ed .
child mortality is a tent@@ h of child mortality .
and the reason that diet , the power , the electricity costs and the cost of trans@@ lation costs have cut down a multi@@ pli@@
steve pin@@ ker showed us that we live in a very pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful time of human history . . history . .
and according to charles ken@@ ny , the al@@ phab@@ ac@@ ism rate has gone from 25 percent to 80 percent in 80 percent .
we live in a really extraordinary time . .
and many people forget this .
and we &apos;re going to increase our expec@@ tations on our own
in fact , we &apos;ve re@@ defined poverty . .
remember that a big percentage of americans who live under poverty are having access to power , water , toi@@ lets , re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , t@@ all , cell@@ phones , climate change , cars . . phones .
the rich@@ est capit@@ alists of the last century , the im@@ per@@ ative brothers of the earth , never have been able to dream such as lux@@ ury . as lux@@
the basis of many of these , these are the technologies , and they grow ex@@ cep@@ tives .
my good friend ray kurz@@ weil has shown us that every tool that is going to become information technology on the cur@@ ve of mo@@ ore &apos;s law , and the price performance source of all 12 to 24 months .
so your mobile phone costs about a million times less , and it &apos;s thousands of times faster than a super@@ computer from the &apos; 7@@ 0s . . .
now look at this cur@@ ve .
this is mo@@ ore &apos;s law of the last hundred years .
notice two things on this cur@@ ve . . .
first , how do you get lost -- in good ways , war or peace , rec@@ ession , depression and high mi@@ en@@ c@@ ement . . .
this is the result of faster computers building faster computers . , building the
it slo@@ ws down for no one of our big problems .
and , despite their log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic , on the left , it &apos;s up@@ ward . on the left . it up@@ ward .
so growth is acceler@@ ating itself . . . .
and on that cur@@ ve , in the back of mo@@ ore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that we have . . .
&quot; clou@@ d-@@ computing , &quot; which my friends call my friends at the car interface , can sensor@@ y sensor@@ s and networks , robots , 3d prin@@ ter , which allow you to democra@@ ti@@ ze personal production on our planet , syn@@ thetic biology , fossil v@@ acc@@ ine , and the ability to use digital intelligence . . . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt
how many of you have seen the vic@@ tory of ib@@ m super@@ computer in &quot; risk ? &quot; ? &quot; risk
that was a seri@@ al . .
i &apos;ve been doing the new@@ spa@@ pers , and i was looking at the best head@@ lines i could find .
i love this : &quot; wat@@ son be@@ ating human ene@@ my . &quot; . &quot; .
risk is not a simple game . . .
it &apos;s about understanding the nu@@ an@@ ces of language .
imagine that this artificial intelligence act of any cell phones is available to your own mobile phone . . . .
four years ago , ray kurz@@ weil , and i &apos;m here at ted , and i &apos;m having &quot; sing@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity
we &apos;re bringing our students all together , with special focus on how these are used to solve the big challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask students to create businesses , businesses and services , which can be positive within the year of billions of people in a decade . human com@@
think about that , a group of students today can impact the lives of billions of people today . . . .
thir@@ ty years ago that it was fu@@ cking . . .
today , we can tell do@@ zens of companies that have been able to do exactly
when i think of creating flow , i don &apos;t mean life of lux@@ ury for everybody on the planet ; it &apos;s what i &apos;m about to create a life of opportunities .
it &apos;s about creating sc@@ ar@@ ce goods . . . . .
sc@@ ar@@ city is con@@ tex@@ ted , and technology is a liber@@ ating force . . . .
here &apos;s an example . .
this is the story of na@@ po@@ le@@ on i@@ i@@ i@@ a in the middle of the 18@@ 0@@ 0s
he &apos;s the guy on the left . .
he &apos;s invited the king of si@@ am to dinner .
na@@ po@@ le@@ on soldiers got sil@@ t@@ .@@ r@@ and@@ ed , na@@ po@@ le@@ on himself , got gol@@ de con@@ tain@@ ers . . . a con@@
but the king of si@@ ein got al@@ umin@@ um con@@ den@@ se . . . .
al@@ umin@@ um was the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than the horse and pla@@ in . . .
this is why the wa@@ king dr@@ um of the dr@@ not was made out of al@@ umin@@ um . .
and though al@@ umin@@ um takes 8@@ .@@ 3 percent of the world , it &apos;s not going to be a bas@@ in metal . . .
it &apos;s connected to oxygen and silicon . . .
but then the technology of the electro@@ ly@@ se developed , and made al@@ umin@@ um in@@ tent , that we use it with our dis@@ pos@@ al ment@@ ality
and then we can put this analog@@ y into the future
we &apos;re thinking today about energy sc@@ ar@@ city
ladies and gentle@@ men , we live on a planet of 5@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ times more energy than we use every year . than a year
16 ter@@ a@@ wat@@ ts of energy pr@@ une in the surface of the earth . .
it &apos;s not a sc@@ ar@@ city problem , the problem is acc@@ essi@@ bility .
and there &apos;s good news . news
this year , you &apos;ve done it for the first time , the cost of solar power in india to 50 percent of the same electricity -- 8@@ .@@ 8 ru@@ pe@@ es compared to 17 ru@@ pe@@ es .
solar , solar , de@@ cre@@ ased by 50 percent of the
last month , this was published with a study that shows that until the end of this decade , the sun areas of the u.s. solar energy will six cents a k@@ v@@ h compared to 15 cents per mass . . a five-@@ cent average
and if we have a energy over@@ load , we &apos;ll also have water in ab@@ und@@ ance
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
do you remember when car@@ l sa@@ gan was in 199@@ 0 , when it was on saturn , back to earth ? , back to earth , went back
he took a famous photograph . how did it mean ?
&quot; a p@@ ale blue do@@ t . &quot;
because we live on a water@@ planet .
we live on a planet that &apos;s covered to 70 percent with
yes , there are 9@@ 7 and a half percent sal@@ t@@ water , two percent are den@@ se , and we &apos;re fighting by 0@@ .@@ 5 percent of the water , but there &apos;s also hope .
and it there &apos;s are new new nan@@ technologies ot@@ , echn@@ not ology in on 10 the or
way 20 , years nan@@ , o@@ but materials now . it &apos;s . now . .
and this morning , with de@@ an ka@@ man , one of the inno@@ v@@ ators of doing this , i want to share with you something -- he gave me the per@@ mission -- his engineering , the &quot; sl@@ ing@@ ra &quot; , &quot; and many of you may have heard about it , has the size of a re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator in the medical school .
it can produce a thousand gall@@ ons of cle@@ an@@ ing clean water every day -- whether sal@@ t@@ water , pollu@@ ted water , la@@ r@@ ine -- and all this for less than two cents a gall@@ on . .
co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a has just launched a great test project to laun@@ ch a hundred un@@ its into developing countries . . . . .
and if everything goes well , and i &apos;m very confi@@ dent , then co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a will apply this technology to be applied to 20@@ 6 countries around the planet . .
this is technology spon@@ sor@@ ed innovation today . . . . .
and we &apos;ve also seen this in mobile phones .
my goo@@ dness , we &apos;ll soon achieve the 70 percent de@@ cre@@ ase rate of mobile phones in developing countries to end 13 . . in
just consider that a mas@@ sa@@ id war@@ ri@@ or with a cell phone in the middle of kenya is a better mobile communication than president re@@ ag@@ an earlier years ago . . .
and if you search with your smart phone on google , you have more access to knowledge and information as a president of a clin@@ ton , 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication in the flow of the way that nobody could have predi@@ cted .
and it &apos;s better than that , which you &apos;ve spent several thousand dollars on -- gps , h@@ d video and photograph , libr@@ aries of books and music to medical diagno@@ stics -- now materi@@ alized and che@@ aper in their mobile phones -- are literally materi@@ alized and che@@ aper in their mobile phone .
and the best part is that what we expect in health is . . .
i had the pleasure of the day , the for@@ mal foundation , which is called &quot; $ 10 million mass tri@@ cor@@ tee , &quot; the x prize . &quot; .
we &apos;re asking teams around the world to connect all of these technologies together in a mobile phone , so that you can talk with the device , because it &apos;s equi@@ pped with ai , you can test your blood values . , you can test your blood
and to win , the device needs a better diagno@@ sis to the very dama@@ ging doctors . sk@@ ill@@ ed doctors . .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the disease bur@@ den and 1.@@ 3 percent of the public health care system .
if this device sequen@@ ced a r@@ na or dna virus that isn &apos;t known , it calls health control and pre@@ vent@@ ing a pan@@ de@@ mic in front of her . . . .
but now the biggest force that will take us to a world of over@@ all . .
i call them the coming billion . .
the white lines are population . lines .
we &apos;ve just gone through the 7@@ -@@ billi@@ on-@@ plus
and just by the way , the biggest in@@ sur@@ ance against population explosion is a better education and nutri@@ tion in
in 2010 , we had two billion people connected online . one with two billion
by 20@@ 20 , we get a predi@@ ctive idea of two billion internet users .
three billion new minds that we &apos;ve never heard of before will be the global communic@@ ations . .
what are these people need ?
what are you going to consu@@ me ? what are you going
and instead of economic st@@ illness , i see one of the largest economic as@@ s@@ ess@@ ments of history .
these people represent multiple dea@@ f dollars that will flow into global economy . .
and they &apos;ll be getting into the use of the tri@@ co@@ der , and they &apos;re going to be getting trained trained by the k@@ han acade@@ my , and by doing that they &apos;re going to have a chance to use 3d prin@@ ter and infin@@ ite computing , and so
so what can we bring to growing , one-@@ to-@@ educ@@ ated , productive , productive members of the human community ?
what about a sentence set of new , never spo@@ ken . .
how about that to be the op@@ pres@@ sed , wher@@ ever you are , give voice to yourself , to make change , the first time ever ? ?
what are these three billion people bring in ?
how about both bit@@ es we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things that i learned from the x prize is that small teams that are motiv@@ ated by the incredible and focus can create extraordinary things , things that have large companies and governments just in the past . in
i want to finish with a story that really got me excited . .
you have a program that maybe you may know . . .
it &apos;s a game that is called tor@@ mail
it was developed at the university of washington in se@@ attle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can actually take a sequence of amin@@ o aci@@ ds to study how protein is going to be going to go .
so depen@@ ding on his behavior , we can predict the structure and function . .
and this is very important in medical research . .
so , this is a problem for super@@ computers . . .
and this game was played by university profess@@ ors and so on . .
and it &apos;s been hundreds of thousands of people who have played the game online . .
and it showed that these days , the human pattern recogni@@ tion is better than the best super@@ computers . than the best super@@ computers . .
and when these guys came and watched who the best protein fol@@ der of the world is , this was not a mit@@ -@@ professor , but it was not a mit@@ tech student , it was someone from england , man@@ che@@ ster , a woman who was working on the do@@ or@@ step as a assi@@ stant to the business trade in a re@@ hab hospital and at night the world &apos;s best protein d@@ ac@@ ters . .
ladies and gentle@@ men , what gives me tremendous confidence in our future is the fact that we are doing more power today to address the big challenges of our planet . . challenges
we we have have access the to passion tools of using a exponenti@@
di@@ al y technology inno@@ . v@@ ator . .
we have the capital of tech@@ no@@ -@@ phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y . .
and we have three billion new minds that we can work on online to master the new challenges , and to do what it takes . .
we expect some extraordinary decades . .
thank you .
i think we need to have a change in trans@@ it medical culture . . . .
and i think it starts with a medical age and i am . .
and maybe i &apos;ve been in business for a long time , than i can afford it to give me a piece of my own mis@@ ch@@ elling pre@@ stige
but before i get to the true issue of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little bit of base@@
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re the seas@@ onal al@@ together and move on the world &apos;s ma@@ c@@ us
we all love base@@ ball , right ? ?
so base@@ ball is full of the great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
mon@@ e@@ y@@ ball will soon appear and turn about statistics and to use a great ball of base@@ ball team . . . a great base@@
i &apos;m going to go on to a statistics that most of you have heard of . , most of
it &apos;s the average performance on the bat
we &apos;re talking about a 300 , if a bat bu@@ cks 300 . .
that means that the player is safe for three of 10 be@@ ats . . . . . .
it &apos;s going to beat the ball in the out@@ put , it comes up , it &apos;s not going to catch the ball , and who &apos;s trying to throw the ball on the first base , it didn &apos;t take on on
three out of 10@@ 1 .
do you know how to call a 3@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ herz lea@@ gue base@@ ball ?
well , really good , maybe a single star . .
you know how to call a 4@@ 00@@ ,@@ 00@@ 00@@ 00@@ 00@@ ,@@
that &apos;s somebody who &apos;s been in the opposite safe from 10 . . . . .
le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y -- like ted willi@@ ams &apos;s ad@@ u@@ m@@ man -- the last ch@@ ase lea@@ gue base@@ ball player , who saw a rain@@ y seas@@ on for 400
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine where i feel a lot of well-@@ comfortable , or maybe a little less good for you to talk about them . . . with
if you have a blind design , you &apos;re trans@@ fer@@ red to a kind of a surgery , your average performance is 400 in terms of blin@@ dness
somehow it doesn &apos;t work , right ? ?
imagine it &apos;s in a certain remote area and you have a belo@@ ved person with sever@@ e heart disease and their company , and you del@@ ay them to a car@@ di@@ a@@ c , whose average performance in the body of cars is 200 . . in 200 . in the con@@ flu@@ tac@@
but , you know what ? ?
she &apos;s a lot better this year . it &apos;s on the ris@@ ing . . .
and it pro@@ pos@@ es a 25@@ 5@@ 7 .
it doesn &apos;t work that way .
but i &apos;ll ask you a question . .
what do you think the average performance for a car@@ di@@ ologist or a nur@@ se or an or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c or a birth@@ man or an or@@ th@@ op@@ a ? a birth@@ man ? a for@@ il@@ a ? a for@@
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that nobody in the whole medicine knows what a good surgeon or a doctor or a de@@ cep@@ tive was supposed to be . . .
what we &apos;re doing though is we &apos;re going to en@@ em@@ me each of you to share me in the world with perfect . . .
never make a mistake , but nobody does it , but it &apos;s about the details of the world , what it is that
and this is the message i took in medical school . . . .
i was a forced student . . . .
in high school , a student told a student that brian gold@@ man would learn for a blood test .
and it was . .
and i learned in my little roof chair in the si@@ sters of general hospital , and i found off on general hospital . from here .
i learned everything out . .
in my an@@ atom@@ ary speaking reading , i learned the orig@@ ins and r@@ uns every reason , every bran@@ ch of every ar@@ ter@@ y that takes away from the a@@ or@@ ta , ob@@ sc@@ ure , ordinary differences . . .
i knew the difference diagno@@ sis to classi@@ fy the ren@@ al tu@@ bu@@ bu@@ re . . . .
and that &apos;s all the time , i gather@@ ed more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i was going to finish with c@@ um lau@@ de . .
and i left the medical school to show that , if i knew everything , and knew everything , or at least as much as possible , as close to complete comfort as possible , that i was im@@ mobile against doing that . . .
and for a while , i was going to work for a while , until i
i was resi@@ stant to a teacher hospital in tor@@ onto as a woman prin@@ ter to me in the hospital department department of the hospital hospital . . . .
at this point , i was the car@@ di@@ a@@ c layer in car@@ di@@ ology service . . .
and it was my per@@ mission when the emergen@@ cy net car@@ di@@ ological coun@@ cil was looking at the emergen@@ cy patient , investi@@ g@@ ating patient patient .
and re@@ view to my upp@@ er doctor .
i studied prin@@ ter in brea@@ thing and she was in brea@@ thing . .
and when i was listening to her , she made no@@ is@@ es . . .
and when i heard her ch@@ est with the ste@@ tho@@ scop@@ e , i could hear a cra@@ ck@@ er sound on both side , and it told me that she was under con@@ ge@@ sti@@ on heart failure .
this is a state where the heart is losing , instead of pump@@ ing the blood on the lung , it &apos;s a part of the blood in the lung and it fil@@ ls out these ill@@ umin@@ ally , therefore the short in@@ door . . , the short in@@ door . .
and that wasn &apos;t a hard diagno@@ sis . .
i put them and made the treatment . . .
i gave her as@@ pir@@ in . i gave her medicine the prin@@ ting of the heart of the heart . .
i gave her medicine to the di@@ u@@ d@@ tics , and the water of the du@@ m@@ b to@@ wel@@ s so that you just google the li@@ qui@@
and over a minute and a half to two hours , she began feeling better . . .
i felt really good . .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent it home . . .
actually , i made two mista@@ kes . .
i sent them home with my heart doctor . .
i didn &apos;t take the listen@@ er on and did what i should have been , what would have been a call for my big doctor to en@@ counter@@ s it so that he had an opportunity to make a chance
and he knew he &apos;d have been able to navi@@ gate some extra information . . . .
i might do it with good reason . reason
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the assi@@ stance of the need for the medical
maybe i wanted to get so successful and so capable of taking up the responsibility for me to have a hand@@ le that i was so hand@@ led and so on to try to get my patients to contact him
my second mistake was worse . . .
and that i sent them home , i ex@@ forced a sound voice in me that tried to tell me , &quot; gold@@ man , no good idea . don &apos;t do it . &quot; . &quot;
i mean , in really missing sense , i was so concerned about self-@@ security that i asked the nur@@ se , who was going to work for women , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay if you go home
and the nur@@ se thought about it and he said , &quot; yeah , i think it will go well . &quot; , i think you &apos;ll be
i remember being as if it was yesterday .
so i sig@@ ned the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e tube and a clin@@ ic and i got them home . . . . .
and i went back to work . . .
and the rest of my day , the night i had this na@@ dest feeling in my sto@@ mach . . . .
but i kept working . . .
and at the end of the day , i qu@@ it my stuff , dro@@ pped the hospital , and i went home to drive the car , and i was going to go home to the park i wouldn &apos;t do
i went to my way home the emergen@@ cy department on my way
and there was another nur@@ se , not the sister who &apos;d been seen for the woman prin@@ ter , but another three words to me , and these three words fear most of the news doctors i know . . the ch@@ ord men i know .
other medical men tend to be these same , but the emergen@@ cy medicine is very special because we &apos;re just seeing the patients . .
three words say , do you remember ? ?
&quot; do you remember the patient you were going to meet at
asked the nur@@ se . . . asked .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in that particular cla@@ y .
so she was back . .
she was back and die . .
about an hour after an hour after which i sent her home , and she collap@@ sed , and the family gave 9@@ 11 . the ba@@ il@@ assi@@ sts , they brought them back to the emergen@@ cy ward with a blood pressure of 50 , which is a dangerous sho@@ ck of sho@@ ck .
she bar@@ ely brea@@ the and was blue . . a
the emergen@@ cy patient did all the str@@ ings . . .
they gave their blood pressure on their own . .
they shu@@ t them up to the tu@@ tor@@ ing
i was sho@@ cked , and i was dra@@ wn into the inner
and i was living this roll@@ er@@ co@@ aster because they went after the vari@@ ation on the inten@@ sive care station and hop@@ ed that she would re@@ cover . . that she would re@@ cover
and after two , three days , it realized that she never would have ever opened up . . .
she had not suff@@ ered one of her brain damage
her family had gather@@ ed .
and over the course of eight days or nine days , they spent the lo@@ vely . . .
the next day they got them -- they were prin@@ ter , a woman , a mother , a mother , and grandmother . . .
you say that you &apos;re the names of the people who never forget
and that was the first i ever learned this . . . .
i made the decision for the next few weeks , and i first learned the un@@ healthy sh@@ ame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt myself , isol@@ ated , not the kind of healthy sh@@ ame you felt , because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues . than you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues .
you all know the healthy sh@@ ame when you give the best of your best friends &apos;s secret , even though that one &apos;s dis@@ per@@ sed in a for@@ war@@ d@@ or , and then you get caught and that best friend leads to this and i have a terrible discussion if you &apos;re at the end that it takes some sort of bu@@ er@@ time and you &apos;ll get
if you &apos;re ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ating , and you never ever make the
this is the kind of edu@@ cational sh@@ ame . .
the un@@ healthy way i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes you sick in the inside of the
it &apos;s the one who tells you not what you did is not what you do . you can do it yourself
and that was what i felt . .
and it wasn &apos;t because of my top , he was very lo@@ aded . .
he talked to the family , and i &apos;m sure he made the wo@@ und and sur@@ ely convinced that i would not be su@@ ing . . .
but i was thinking about these questions .
why did i not ask the rule of the face ? why did i occu@@ pan@@ ate
and then my worst moments : how could i make a stupid er@@ ror ? ?
why slowly did , i it go turned to out medicine
to ? be safe ? . in .
i started feeling better . . .
and then on a wee@@ k@@ ly day , there was a hole in the clou@@ ds and the sun , and maybe i can feel better again . feeling better . feeling better
and i was as@@ sum@@ ing that if i dou@@ bled my eff@@ or@@ ts to perfe@@ ction and never give a bo@@ il that the voice could be terri@@ fied . .
and and she i did kept . working
on . . . .
and then it happened again .
two years later i had service in the emergen@@ cy center in a community hospital north of tor@@ onto and i wor@@ ship a 25@@ -year-old man with dra@@ wed gli@@ mp@@ se . . a
it was much less gone , and i was in a hur@@ d@@ le .
he always poin@@ ted here .
i looked in the ru@@ t , and it was a little bit embar@@ ras@@ sed
and i gave him a phr@@ ase for pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin and sent him to him . .
and then , even when he went out the door , he showed up on his ra@@ w . . .
two days later , i came to my next pit@@ ch@@ case service and my che@@ ap@@ man , and i asked me to go on to the school . . .
and she said three words : do you remember ? ?
&quot; do you remember the patient with the very easy ra@@ p ? &quot; ?
it he turns had out a he potential was life@@ a -@@ tra@@ dangerous p@@ disease co@@ called co@@
the c@@ epi@@ ic gl@@ infe@@ ot@@ ction ti@@ . tis . . . .
you can get goo@@ gl@@ ers , but it &apos;s not infe@@ ction of ra@@ il , but the top min@@ or and caus@@ ing the brea@@ thing down . . . . .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
he got an anti-@@ bo@@ o@@ th@@ ous anti-@@ bo@@ om@@ a and re@@ covered a few days later .
and i went back through the same tor@@ ture of sho@@ ot@@ y and self-@@ dou@@ bt , and i felt re@@ gre@@ ed and went back to work until it happened and again and again
in an emergen@@ cy class , i &apos;ve seen two times a blind mental design .
there &apos;s some things that i &apos;ve been hearing about , especially when you think you &apos;re working in a hospital that was only 14
in both cases , i sent them home , and i wouldn &apos;t have a flo@@ wing either , and i don &apos;t have a
and i thought he had ki@@ dney st@@ ones .
i put x-@@ ray on the ki@@ d@@ g@@ ine . when it was without the evidence , my collea@@ gue had a re@@ vision of the patient &apos;s re@@ vision in the bottom right . and called the oper@@ ator . . . .
the other one had strong di@@ ar@@ rhe@@ a . .
i and beat he air@@ did s , to and re@@ as hy@@ he dri@@ noticed te a it di@@ and ar@@ asked di@@
my on colleagues on to the actually right re@@ sector cu@@ , sa@@ he te called him the . oper@@ at@@ . ers
in both both of cases them , were surgery in became love surgery with , me and
. they were . doing well . . . . .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst er@@ r@@ ors were only going to achieve in the first five years , which is a lot of my colleagues , but total non@@ sense .
some of my myster@@ ies happened in the last five years . . .
by itself , sh@@ it@@ ter@@ ed and without support
here &apos;s the problem : if i didn &apos;t close my l@@ ens and talk about them , if i &apos;m lucky , which tells me what really happened , how can i share it with my collabor@@ ators ? ? ? my
how do i teach you my mista@@ kes so that you don &apos;t get the same ones ? ,
if i &apos;m in a room -- like now , i have no idea what you think about me . . .
when &apos;s the last time you &apos;ve ever heard of somebody who was wrong about fail@@ ures
oh yeah , you go to a cock@@ tail party , and you might hear about anybody else &apos;s , but you &apos;re not going to hear anybody about your mista@@ kes . .
when i would ask in a room full of colleagues and to talk to their so@@ vi@@ et support and to tell you what i &apos;ve just told you about , i &apos;m very likely not to reach the end of the second story before you really would have a good idea of making it really un@@ comfortable to you , any one would switch the issue and the rest of the rest
and actually , if i or my colleagues knew that an or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c in my hospital had taken somebody wrong on my hospital , then they believe me , i had trouble looking at him . . . .
that &apos;s the system in which we live .
it &apos;s a completely den@@ ial of er@@ r@@ ors .
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic posi@@ tions -- the ones that make er@@ r@@ ors and those who don &apos;t . the ones who don &apos;t do it , the ones who are dis@@ con@@ cer@@ ting and the people who don &apos;t do the bad results and the good results .
it &apos;s almost an ide@@ ological response like anti@@ bodies that attack a human . . . .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we have the ones that make mista@@ kes from medicine , we have a sure system . . . .
but there are two problems . .
in my like 20 years of the medical record and journ@@ alism , i &apos;ve got a personal medical study on medical mista@@ k@@ ings and wrong treat@@ ies , and i &apos;ve written a personal study on medical mista@@ kes and wrong treat@@ ments , and i wrote , learning . . . . , learning .
and what i learned is that mista@@ kes are absolutely dis@@ placed . . . .
we &apos;re working in a system where every day we seem to catch mista@@ kes in a given time , which is either a fa@@ ke or wrong dose in the hospital hospital , getting in and over and over and caus@@ ing a lot of de@@ va@@ station . . . . w@@ ins , and
in this state , about 24@@ ,000 can@@ adi@@ an people die in the state of o@@ dor@@ -@@ do@@ sted mista@@ kes
the institute for medicine is the basis for medi@@ cin@@ es . in the united states
they &apos;re very strong under@@ ground because we don &apos;t really care about the problem of the way that we should . . . .
and is the gra@@ x .
in a hospital system where medical knowledge , all of you have dou@@ bled , we can &apos;t help up . . .
sleep sle@@ eping is u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous . .
we can &apos;t get rid of him .
we have a cognitive er@@ ror , so we can take a perfect disease on a patient with a hea@@ da@@ che .
and i take the same patient with the ch@@ est pain , i swe@@ at@@ u@@ red and ad@@ v@@ ance and give a little al@@ co@@ ho@@ li@@ zed breath , and suddenly the story is beginning to wonder . . .
i don &apos;t take the same track .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i &apos;m not doing things the same way . .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t always tell me the symptom@@ s in the same way . .
all of this is in@@ ex@@ able to make mista@@ kes .
so if you take the system as i was taught , and i &apos;ve been doing all the fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed health workers , then at the end of the time , no more than that
and you know the easier people who want to talk about their worst cases ? ?
in my show , &quot; white co@@ at , black art . &quot; i &apos;m the hab@@ it to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to each of the res@@ il@@ al pa@@ sts to the ch@@ ir@@ er , &quot; this is my worst mistake &quot; bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , &quot; what about her ? &quot; and then i show the micro@@ phone to him . . a thing and then i show
and then your pu@@ p@@ ils come , they po@@ pped off the head , then look down and sc@@ is@@ hed , and they start to tell their stories . .
they want to share their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t do the same mista@@ kes i was making .
what they need is an environment that will make you feel able to do
what you need is a new medical culture . .
and it starts with a doctor . . .
the re@@ defined of the physi@@ cian is a human , white knows , is not to make it wrong , but it &apos;s all to be learned from them so that it can be passed on . . . .
it divi@@ des their experiences with others .
it suppor@@ ts other people talking from their mista@@ kes . .
and it &apos;s be@@ ating other people &apos;s mistake , not to con@@ temp@@ late , but in a lo@@ ving , suppor@@ tive way , so that everybody &apos;s contribu@@ ting to it
and she &apos;s working in a medical culture that recogni@@ zes that people are living the system with life , and when they are , people also make mista@@ kes from time to time . . .
so that the system will evol@@ ve to create bac@@ ku@@ ps , which make it easier to scre@@ am to er@@ ase mista@@ kes , to create the people who make the health care , even as much as pus@@ hing , to create support of support in which anyone who looks at health care is actually actually capable of making things that are possible , and that will be specific for people like me to make er@@ r@@ ation in this re@@ wards . . for people like me who
my name is brian gold@@ man .
i &apos;m the re@@ defined . .
i &apos;m a man . i do mista@@ kes .
i feel there . but i &apos;m trying to learn best to pass on to others . on top of it .
i don &apos;t know what you think of me , but i can live with it . .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember . .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about changing standards . . .
and because you can explain this idea , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories about how to use the time . .
the first story is charles darwin , one of my hero@@ es . .
you know that he was in 18@@ 35 here . . .
you might think that he had fin@@ ies , but that &apos;s not true . .
and actually , he colle@@ cted fish .
he described one of them as &quot; u@@ tili@@ ti@@ zing . &quot;
it was a z@@ as@@ thou@@ per . .
and in the &apos; 8@@ 0s , he was fis@@ hed into great style .
now it &apos;s on the red list . dangerous . .
we &apos;ve heard this story many times from the gala@@ pa@@ gos , or from other places , it &apos;s not very special . . .
yet , we still get to the gala@@ pa@@ gos . .
we still think they &apos;re origin@@ ally . .
the bro@@ ck@@ les describe them un@@ tou@@ ched . .
what happened here ? ?
the second story would be a different concept , the changing sta@@ tions , indi@@ c@@ ating . .
because i was seeing a la@@ go@@ on when i studied a la@@ go@@ on in the west africa
i went there because i grew up in europe , and i wanted to work in africa later .
i thought i could let myself to let myself .
and i got a bad sun@@ light , and i was convinced that i wasn &apos;t going to go from there
it was my first sol@@ li@@ l .
you can see , the la@@ go@@ on of pal@@ ms and some of the man@@ gro@@ ves were hu@@ dd@@ led around . .
there were something about the 20@@ -@@ in@@ centi@@ ves , sub-@@ c@@ ale wall , an under@@ dog of the bun@@ k . . .
the fis@@ her@@ ies of these bun@@ k were very ent@@ ra@@ ced , and the fis@@ her@@ men were good at the fis@@ her@@ men who were good at the ex@@ act
when i re@@ turned to it for 27 years later , the fish was s@@ hr@@ in@@ king half its hei@@ ghts
they &apos;ve grown up five centi@@ meters . .
they were gene@@ tically pres@@ sed . .
they were still fish . fish
people were still happy . .
and the fish also had been lucky , even there .
so nothing changed , and yet it changed . changed
my third little story , my third little story , talks about the train network of the city , sou@@ the@@ ast asia . .
in the 197@@ 0s -- more at the beginning of the &apos; 6@@ 0s -- europe has many development projects . .
and the other thing that has happened is , the countries that have been growing around 100 fish , the industrial fishing tra@@ ins that have is mu@@ ti@@ ar@@ a 4@@ 7
i went on and we made er@@ r@@ als all around the south south of china , and in the ja@@ vas@@ e@@ e . in the
we didn &apos;t have words for what we were starting there . .
i now know that it was the cause of the ocean . . .
90 percent of our path were spon@@ tane@@ ous , other animals associated with the cause . . .
most of the fish that are the little dots on the sta@@ ir@@ store , the pe@@ e of the cro@@ p , were coral re@@ ef@@ s . fish . fish
and the reason the ocean came from the ground and then was back . . .
these pictures are extraordinary , because the transition goes very fast . .
within a year , you &apos;re going to get an survey of a survey ,
the reason is trans@@ formed . -- in this case , a hard ground or a long cor@@ n is going to be mat@@ ched .
this is a dead tur@@ tle .
they &apos;re not e@@ aten , you were going to be dead . . .
we started one day . . .
she wasn &apos;t dr@@ un@@ k . .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them well .
in fact , this mountain of cru@@ m@@ bra@@ l bag@@ s is colle@@ cted by fishing every time they &apos;re going into areas that have never been seen
but it &apos;s not going to docum@@ ent
we &apos;re changing the world , but don &apos;t remember it .
we &apos;re just ad@@ ding our hab@@ its to the new level , and we don &apos;t re@@ mind ourselves of what was
so , if you gener@@ alize it , what happens .
on the y-@@ axis , there are some good things : bio@@ diversity , number of or@@ ca , the green reser@@ ve . green . water supply
over time , it changes . it changes because for the people , they naturally are natural
every generation looks at the images in your mind at the beginning of her conscious life as standard and will de@@ v@@ ise everything . .
the difference then becomes a loss . . . .
but they don &apos;t take the pre@@ ci@@ pit@@ ary los@@ ses .
it can give a sequence of changes . .
and just by the end , you just want to get the loss of the rema@@ ining
that &apos;s what we &apos;re a@@ ager now . . . . .
we want to get things that are disappe@@ ared or things that are no longer as they were .
you might think that the problem is people who are sur@@ ely , when they lived in their lives , were they killed , and they were not aware of the generations that
because obviously a animal that was very often realized , first of all , before it &apos;s fro@@ zen . . .
so , you don &apos;t lose very often in fa@@ vor
you &apos;re getting less and more rare
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not a huge loss of loss .
and over time , we &apos;re focused on the big animals and the sea that are the big fish .
they &apos;re going to be rare because we &apos;re cat@@ ching
with time , little fish are left , and we think that &apos;s value . . .
the question is , why do people accept that ? .
well , because they &apos;re not aware that it was different .
of course , a lot of people , scientists , assu@@ me that it was really different . .
they will con@@ fir@@ m it because the evidence as they represent in an earlier form are not the way the evidence would be to be applied .
for example , there &apos;s the an@@ ec@@ d@@ ot@@ es that the report of a chap@@ ter saw so@@ und@@ ly known as that , which is , in this area , there can be a lot of fish , not being used , because it &apos;s not &quot; scienti@@
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , despite the fact that we &apos;re living in the edu@@ cational societies , because they don &apos;t trust the out@@ come
this shows the tremendous role that can play a marine prote@@ cted area . .
because through marine reser@@ ves , we basically have the past back . .
we &apos;re going to bring the past back , the people that are not able to recognize because the common values are changing and are
so the people who see a marine prote@@ cted area and reach out of sight that en@@ able it to re@@ move their level of their values . . . . . .
what about the people that aren &apos;t possible because they don &apos;t have access to -- people in the mid@@ west for example ?
so here i think the art and the film may be maybe the gap , and simul@@ ating
this is the simulation of ch@@ es@@ a@@ pe@@ a@@ ke bay .
there were a long time ago , there were gra@@ m@@ als -- 500 years ago . . . .
and the color and the sli@@ des , you might remember &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar . &quot; . &quot;
if you think of &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; if you think about why people are so tou@@ ched -- except from the po@@ ca hon@@ s story , why were they so tou@@ ched by the visual world ? , why
because it &apos;s a little wa@@ mor@@ y that has lost in a way .
so my re@@ com@@ men@@ dation , the only one i &apos;m going to give you , is to go to c@@ amer@@ on , so he &apos;s under@@ water . &quot; water
thank you . .
in the &apos; 8@@ 0s , the commun@@ ist eastern germany , you had to , if you had a ty@@ pe@@ writer , that cor@@ respon@@ ds to government government
they and also the had reason to it regi@@ was ster , a the paper government with could for@@ pull
mer@@ back ly where in a this text ty@@ came pe@@ in writer . . . .
did you find an article with fal@@ se thought , you could find the cre@@ ator of this idea . .
and we have not been able to understand how anybody could do that , and how much that would give us freedom of freedom .
we would never do this in our own countries .
but if you can buy a new color prin@@ ter of the leading las@@ er prin@@ ter , and print a page , then this page has stri@@ ved yellow blo@@ b on each side , put it into a pattern that clearly makes the page clearly to her and her prin@@ ter . . a little bit of the way .
that &apos;s what happens today . .
and nobody &apos;s not going to raise up . . .
and this was an example of how our own governments , the technology , are going to use technology . citizens
and this is one of the three main sources of these who exi@@ sted today
so let &apos;s see what &apos;s really happening in the world : we can divi@@ de the attac@@ ks in categ@@ ories . . the attac@@
we there have are three online main
crimin@@ groups als . .
for example , here , this is mr. di@@ mit@@ ry gol@@ u@@ bo@@ w from k@@ ho@@ w in the u@@ kra@@ ine .
and the mo@@ ti@@ fs of online crimin@@ als are very easy to understand .
these people make money .
they &apos;re using online attac@@ ks to ear@@ n a lot of money , a huge amount of money
there are several other cases of online milli@@ on@@ ai@@ ans that have made their money money from attac@@ ks . . . .
this is w@@ la@@ di@@ mir t@@ sa@@ st@@ s@@ in from tar@@ tu , in est@@ on@@ ia .
this is al@@ fre@@ d gon@@ z@@ ale@@ z .
ste@@ phen wat@@ ts . .
b@@ j@@ f@@ n &apos;s s@@ und@@ in . .
these are mat@@ the@@ w ander@@ son , t@@ ari@@ q al da@@ o@@ r and so on and so forth .
these people have come online to ri@@ ce , but they have illegal as they &apos;ve used , like , tro@@ j@@ er to put money out of our bank bank , as we do our online ban@@ king job , or the key@@ log@@ gers who have colle@@ cted our credit card information to the key@@ board while we &apos;re buying over an infe@@ cted computer
the u.s. intelligence agen@@ cy gave the s@@ wis@@ s bank two months ago the s@@ wis@@ s bank to mr. ja@@ in here , and on this gover@@ n , 14@@ .@@ 9 million u.s. dollars , when it was fro@@ zen .
and mr. ja@@ in himself is on a very close foot , and the next place is
and i would like to say that today , we are more likely to be vic@@ ti@@ ms of an online con@@ co@@ ction than a mix@@ ing in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this will get even worse . .
in the future , most of the cri@@ mes are going to play online
the second largest community that we can see today is not motiv@@ ated by money . . .
they &apos;re motiv@@ ated by something -- prote@@ sts about , say , an opini@@ on , or through their audience . . . .
groups like anony@@ mous are up over the last 12 months , and has become one of the main players on the field of online attac@@ ks .
so these are the three main vie@@ ws of these : crimin@@ als who are doing it in the money , ha@@ cking ha@@ cks like anony@@ mous , who are concerned with , but the last group is nations , governments that are moving the attack .
there &apos;s us to think of us as a result of the dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar
it shows us exactly what happens when governments attack their own citizens . . .
wr@@ in in@@ the ot@@ last ar fall is , a it full had body to cer@@ clean ti@@ it fi@@ up cate in from
a the sol@@ ne@@ ace ther@@ , lands because -- the or pun@@ it in@@ was ot@@ that ar . had been . ha@@
somebody was broken and ha@@ cked up the system . a broken system
and i did a meeting last week in a meeting with a hand@@ -@@ down government asking if he knew it could be able to appreci@@ ate that because of the case of the ab@@ in@@ ot@@ al ha@@ ck people died . . people
and his answer was , &quot; yes
now , how do people die of a ha@@ ck of a ha@@ ck ?
wr@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is a cer@@ ti@@ fied com@@
they sell cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ cate . .
what do you do with cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ c@@ ating ?
now , it takes you to use a cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ cate when you have a website with h@@ tt@@ p , with s@@ l &apos;s en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted services , for
now we &apos;re all using , or many of us , g@@ mail , or one of your competition , but these are particularly common in complete al@@ it@@ arian states like g@@ mail , where dis@@ si@@ dents use the foreign supply of the country , because they know they can trust more than local leaders and that they &apos;re en@@ co@@ ded over s@@ l connections , so that the local government doesn &apos;t sp@@ ell in their conversation . . off .
but if you were to get into an out@@ door foreign .
cer@@ ti@@ fication , ha@@ cking and fa@@ ke cer@@ ti@@
and that &apos;s what &apos;s happened in the case of the phr@@ in@@ ot@@ ar all
how does it compare to the arab spring and the things that have happened in eg@@ y@@ pt for example
now , in eg@@ y@@ pt , the ad@@ v@@ ance of 20@@ 11 , the main central director of eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an western police , and they found a lot of action . . . . . . . .
in these ac@@ ts , a fol@@ der named &quot; fin@@ eg@@ men . &quot; . .
and in this fol@@ der , in a gather@@ ing company , a new gather@@ ing company in germany had sold some programs that they sold with -- in very large fra@@ mes -- any communication in the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an citizens . . .
they sold this program for 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 euro@@ s to the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government . .
the center of the company is right there .
so the western governments are leaving a coun@@ t@@ less governments with tools to move against their own citizens . .
but western governments also help themselves . . .
for example , in germany just a few weeks ago , we found stat@@ in@@ ai@@ ans called stat@@ in@@ ai@@ ans , and this was a tro@@ j@@ an who was used by ger@@ man govern@@ mental offi@@ ci@@ als to pun@@ ch
if you &apos;re lo@@ cated in a crimin@@ al situation , you &apos;re going to be stock@@ pil@@ ed by se@@ cure sur@@ faces . ,
but they today ta@@ we p are their far
internet beyond connection that . . .
they use resources like the state director to map their computers with a tro@@ j@@ an who allows them to monit@@ or their entire communication , to monit@@ or their online discussion , to collect their pas@@ sages . their pas@@ s@@ words . .
so if we &apos;re going to think about things like this , the obvious answer of people would say , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but i &apos;m not sure it &apos;s bad for me , because i &apos;m a
i don &apos;t have to worry
i have nothing to hi@@ de . &quot; .
and that reas@@ oning makes no sense . . .
priv@@ acy must be given .
priv@@ acy is not debate . .
it &apos;s not a decision between priv@@ acy and safety .
it &apos;s a decision between liber@@ ty and control .
and as we now today , in 20@@ 11 , we may trust our governments , but every is right that we will abo@@ st@@ it , forever .
and we know , we know , we &apos;re blind to every future government , a government that maybe we will have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we &apos;re going to have to deal with the next 50 years .
it may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of con@@ cre@@ te block . .
the first em@@ ph@@ yp@@ le we created in 18@@ 6@@ 8 was made and de@@ vis@@ ed a simple idea : mo@@ du@@ le from c@@ ement with a broken way of meas@@ uring that . .
and em@@ ph@@ et@@ le ro@@ cks became very rapi@@ dly the most sc@@ ary building unit in
they put us into the shoes of building things bigger than us , buildings , bri@@ d@@ ges , a stone after the other . . .
essentially , the em@@ ph@@ as@@ is was becoming the building block of our time
and so , almost a hundred years later in 194@@ 7 , le@@ go came out with
it was called auto@@ matically lin@@ ked rock . .
and within a few years , le@@ go went into every house@@ hold . . .
it &apos;s been esti@@ ma@@ ted that over 400 billion st@@ st@@ s have made up on the planet -- or 75 blocks for each person on
they don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bri@@ d@@ ges , beautiful building .
le@@ go made it for everyone . .
le@@ go basically has the con@@ cre@@ te block , taken the world &apos;s em@@ pi@@ re , took out of it into a c@@ ash for the possibility .
in the mean@@ time , at the bell lab@@ s , the next revolution was announ@@ ced , the next building . building . the next
the transi@@ st@@ or was a little plastic unit that would take us from a world of sta@@ tic , con@@ ta@@ ined , con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ated building blocks to a world where it was inter@@ active
like the con@@ cre@@ tor block , it allows the transi@@ st@@ or to build much greater , more complex cir@@ cular processes , a stone after another . .
but there &apos;s a big difference : the transi@@ st@@ or was only for experts .
i personally don &apos;t accept that the building block is reser@@ ved for experts , and so i decided to change it . . .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started to study this idea of how to put the power of engineers on the hands of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its .
let me show you how they work .
li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its are electr@@ onic mo@@ du@@ le that have a specific function .
they &apos;re pre-@@ designed to be light , sound , motor and sen@@ sor . .
and the best part is they connect with magne@@ ts . . .
so you can &apos;t put them wrong around . .
the stone is color@@ ed . . .
green is the power , blue is electricity , p@@ ink is power and orange is wir@@ es .
so all you have to do is to connect blue and a green green , and you can build bigger cir@@ cles very quickly .
you add a blue to your green , and you can make light .
you can put a switch in between and they make a little di@@ ck . . .
take the switch out to a c@@ ran@@ l box , and this is , you know , putting a little blind . . .
add that bu@@ zz@@ er for an extra effect , and you &apos;ve made a noise machine .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
and it &apos;s actually a pretty powerful play about the simple play , which is
instead of having to code , wir@@ ing or commit@@ ting , you &apos;ve got to program it , you can use it with simple , intui@@ tive gest@@ ures
so to acceler@@ ate the blin@@ k or slow down , you just turn on that butt@@ on and it &apos;s going to make the moment@@ um faster or slo@@
the idea behind li@@ tt@@ leb@@ it is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want every single interaction on this world in a cu@@ tt@@ ing-@@ edge organ . . .
ligh@@ ter , sound , solar , mot@@ ors -- everything should be available . .
we distribu@@ ted li@@ tt@@ leb@@ ars to kids and see them playing with it . .
and it was an un@@ belie@@ vable experience .
the most beautiful thing is , as you start to understand the electr@@ on@@ ics you &apos;re going to understand in your daily life and you &apos;re not
like , for example , a ro@@ ot light works , or why the do@@ ors are re@@ acting to the el@@ ev@@ ator , or re@@ acting to the d@@ ot@@
we &apos;ve brought li@@ tt@@ leb@@ its to design schools . .
so we had no experience with no experience in electr@@ onic things that started playing with li@@ tt@@ leb@@ ar material as a material . . . .
here we see fil@@ ming , paper and water bot@@ tles , like geor@@ ges ... .
so a couple of weeks ago , we took li@@ tt@@ leb@@ ari@@ ties to ris@@ d , and we gave them some designers that didn &apos;t have any technical experience -- only kar@@ d@@ ton , wood and paper -- and they said to them
here &apos;s an example of a project they did , a movement activ@@ ated con@@ gressi@@ onal con@@ gressi@@ onal can@@ n@@ one .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
it &apos;s a hum@@ b@@ ble of pla@@ y-@@ do@@ h who &apos;s in the dar@@ k@@ ness .
for those non-@@ engineers , li@@ tt@@ leb@@ hu@@ hu@@ a became another material , and electr@@ on@@ ics was just another
and we want to make this material available for everyone . .
so li@@ tt@@ leb@@ hu@@ v source . .
they can go to the website , they &apos;re all going to down@@ load all the design direc@@ tors .
we want to be able to make the world &apos;s cre@@ ators , inv@@ ent@@ or , the co-@@ government , because this world , in which we live in , this inter@@ active world is
so just pull los off and start inv@@ enting
thank you .
