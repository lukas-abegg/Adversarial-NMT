we &apos;re losing it .
oh my god !
a lot of stuff .
yeah . okay .
... not yet .
thank you .
are everybody all ?
this was incredible .
we &apos;re going to fix .
solar technology is ...
three out of 101 .
oh my god .
we love entertainment .
we love innovation .
after a week .
what does that mean ?
this is not ...
so , go to where ?
we were poor .
what does that mean ?
no hospital .
it &apos;s interesting .
thank you .
you can get the only chance .
yes , yes .
music as a language .
yeah , so you can .
but it &apos;s going .
not rather than that .
you need time .
it &apos;s quick .
that &apos;s wrong .
fantastic , right ?
yes , hi .
the sun is going up .
that &apos;s what singing .
that &apos;s hard .
cool trick ?
ta-da !
we were .
a few less .
and he says ...
we know that .
that sounds good ?
here it is .
it &apos;s terrible .
i don &apos;t know .
thank you . thank you !
hold two .
stephen watt .
you can go in .
you could see manhattan .
it &apos;s essential .
so where do we go ?
from seattle ...
here &apos;s the video .
it has sensors .
i was standing around him .
so it &apos;s true .
so they knew everything .
it &apos;s generative .
i have a question .
i was amazed .
they &apos;re all important .
florida is blank .
so they do it .
there is no normal .
because you know what ?
yeah , i know .
how do we know that ?
very different term .
but you know what ?
player are not around .
why not live longer ?
oh , so this is the one .
that &apos;s very good .
a couple more .
he opens the door .
that would be okay .
why do we do that ?
it doesn &apos;t work in some way .
so she was back .
i don &apos;t think so .
here &apos;s an example .
what do these people need ?
hey , why not ?
or they were bombing .
but i was working on .
so i think that &apos;s interesting .
and she did .
and i was working on .
what &apos;s happened here ?
that &apos;s what happens today .
i was thinking about it .
well , pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
oh . a moment .
so they make al .
so how does it work ?
what &apos;s happened here ?
centers were built .
i don &apos;t know .
how curious they are .
okay . thank you .
i &apos;m going in here .
and that &apos;s important .
they use their hands .
there are two options .
reconcitation .
it &apos;s not a country .
thank you very much .
and it has to go back .
wonderful , can it ?
that &apos;s our present .
yes , milliseconds .
i want to tell you .
we can do it differently .
they have similar principles .
totally inefficient .
what are media today ?
that &apos;s efficiency .
all the environmental discussions .
not guill .
what do they say ?
why does this happen ?
we can do that .
just make your job .
good work . yes !
what do you want to do ?
thank you very much .
this was the result .
can we change it ?
all of this interest .
this is the last one .
yes , it goes .
flying cat .
so let &apos;s see .
yes , good afternoon .
that &apos;s it .
not toxic in it .
these days are over .
that &apos;s a wish .
it &apos;s a crisis .
that was fascinating .
incredibly exciting .
we need energy .
that &apos;s great .
can i be honest ?
bg : thank you .
they haul . &quot;
sound familiar , what ?
what was the result ?
and i understand that .
but you know what ?
and i was an artist .
it doesn &apos;t happen very often .
that &apos;s the system .
what a fish .
you see it immediately .
nothing happens at all .
yes , good afternoon .
it &apos;s already done .
lento , slowly .
robert gupta .
the farm is incredible .
not very sustainable .
let &apos;s call it don &apos;t .
that &apos;s me .
what do they do ?
these people make money .
thank you very much .
good afternoon , everybody together .
play is not silly .
so what happened after that ?
ooh , thank you .
will it be my size ?
am i going to like the color ?
be a mentor .
i swear it .
here &apos;s the city .
it was very much like him .
here it is .
his name is tempting .
so she was constantly doing that .
who are these characters ?
it feels great .
thank you .
conflict is generated creativity .
it sounds silent .
that sounds crazy , right ?
the game is from 2007 .
i &apos;ll go now to the end .
i want to ask you a little bit .
you can see the water coming .
these changes are coming .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s not .
or is it possible ?
some of them came and went .
maybe 10 times as many .
i wanted to keep us healthy .
i had a good life .
dk : 60,000 .
there was remixe .
and then it became international .
first , limited .
okay , a few more .
what do i look at ?
let me sum up .
this is what the graphics looked like .
the answer is no .
just further . lots of fun .
ohhhh .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
after just a trip there .
my gut instinct refers .
is it a photograph at all ?
i created one .
he had the experience .
that &apos;s the short-by-wrapping .
that &apos;s a great question .
almost identical structure .
but it gets worse .
is that your mind ?
jk : both .
imagine the camera .
and even better .
i grew up in india .
hold your fresh .
yeah . all right .
that &apos;s a great question .
my name is amamitos .
and it took 18 months .
it &apos;s not for emotion .
now , what does that mean ?
there &apos;s an old study .
give peo a opportunity .
you can &apos;t have bones .
they had no mass media .
we &apos;re not making ourselves more .
that &apos;s not going to do it .
does anybody see something different ?
that &apos;s what you need to understand .
how do we actually do it ?
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s not a protection .
luckily , yes ?
isn &apos;t that sad ?
we &apos;re too many .
but where are we useful ?
they didn &apos;t have books .
but the wrong things .
i &apos;m a writer .
and i had it .
very expensive estate .
here &apos;s another example .
but i felt worse .
they even do .
why should we do that ?
the work of the interprets .
you see that down .
why not think about that ?
shouldn &apos;t be unmuned .
this is felix .
the orange tractor .
... invent his own story .
in china it was different .
so , what does that mean ?
and why is that ?
people were crazy .
who will make it secure ?
so what do we need to do ?
we need to spread the news .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
what do you think happened ?
an enormous challenge .
it &apos;s really cool . &quot;
the data came in .
it &apos;s called paul offit .
i &apos;m going to tell you totally .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
yeah , here it is .
we first have the population .
but it didn &apos;t .
i can say anything .
we were 20 people .
that &apos;s what most people are familiar with .
i wonder .
it &apos;s against justice .
i mean the soul .
what &apos;s the soul ?
you make it comparative .
i don &apos;t like that question .
what would it be done ?
it &apos;s prevention .
let &apos;s do it also .
but what do you eat your fish ?
there &apos;s no food .
is that the light ?
i felt really good .
i actually did two errors .
he went up and down .
what else can we do ?
it &apos;s probably a reality .
and a lot of people forget this .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
11,000 , very good .
and so it was .
it would be successful .
we &apos;re constantly cutting each other .
and then it happened again .
he was always pointing there .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
there were still fish .
we have three main groups .
there are online criminals .
privacy must be expected .
we love technology and creativity .
what does the illusion make ?
it would be unbearable .
i &apos;ll never forget .
i will never forget that .
there &apos;s something else .
did you see these guys ?
so that &apos;s what they look like .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s about .
it &apos;s got billions of them .
but what are we doing about this ?
and this is a map .
here &apos;s another example .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i was devastated .
we have become a touch .
i teach children .
the only country in the world .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
it &apos;s not our problem .
i &apos;ll stop that .
the way it works .
the key thing is ...
and that actually is what he &apos;s saying .
so paul is a terrorist .
no one has said that before .
the data constantly shows .
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
very frightening .
don &apos;t take anything for granted .
and the shape is a role .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
and here &apos;s a surprise .
they didn &apos;t change the story .
they have so much uncertainty .
because somebody can hide it ?
and finally , epc meaning .
what should our testimony look like ?
this one has the largest impact .
so they saw something magic .
so i made the film .
what lessons we learned ?
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
they create an epic story .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
it was a huge success .
and then it gets to realize .
who &apos;s the most successful ?
so that &apos;s the good news .
the same thing , only bigger .
it &apos;s a completely different notion .
they want to feed the world ?
you can have these cloud .
they can play with various types .
ity wins . yeah .
they saw the great impact .
and then everyone went down .
the data didn &apos;t reach there before .
the whole building was made of water .
on the morning , before the game .
they become the computer in the wild .
i was awe for the betus .
that &apos;s about five feet long .
that was the journey of the journey .
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
she did three years .
first , the longevity , second .
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
what about fitness ?
is that all inadequate ?
so , we can do that .
so , before i say -- who is normal ?
i was really going to make sure that at that time , i was really useful
which one would love most ?
how many people would choose creativity ?
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
we &apos;ve achieved a kind of balance .
now , how could that have happened ?
and that was 19 years ago .
well , i was the neck .
play doesn &apos;t just play to buy kindergarten .
creativity had to be out .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
i almost never weak .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
they can &apos;t store energy .
for example , this perception in context .
anyone know what this is ?
we should not be working .
so it &apos;s a circle .
then i can transmit the whole thing .
what &apos;s actually happening ?
so why are it now ?
we &apos;re depending on two countries .
and we take this up .
and we &apos;re too many .
we say in germany , we say in germany .
every waste is nutrient .
that &apos;s a game for outside .
if it &apos;s right now that &apos;s waste .
okay , that &apos;s really rational .
so , that &apos;s kind of like , you know .
now , it &apos;s just just true .
and the answer is yes .
they could have done better .
so let me remember .
everyone needs a gold fish .
does it curious ?
they really loved it .
is that sensible ?
so the question is : how ?
what &apos;s the thing ?
that &apos;s god , you know ?
this was happening around christmas .
so , not like detox .
and the answer is no . &quot;
and of course , that &apos;s incredibly tall .
i loved two loloved .
it &apos;s not technology .
they &apos;re all they say , why ?
can &apos;t be a problem .
and here &apos;s the picture .
and then they hired it .
thank you for your attention .
and already they have a problem .
&quot; of course i said .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
doesn &apos;t taste very well .
i wanted to support her .
2.5 to one , great .
there are four and a half thousand people living there .
he showed up at the algae .
an autistic student .
we can &apos;t do that easy .
that &apos;s what you can train .
it just wasn &apos;t invented .
and how did it feel like ?
it &apos;s always going to get more and more .
she told me that .
he was already over 60 .
again , you have it again .
now there &apos;s a third set .
i can tell everything i can .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
it didn &apos;t have that soul .
it &apos;s such a natural thing .
but it was very sad .
what are you trying to do ? &quot;
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
and there &apos;s good news .
that was an oo .
crisis . death . disaster .
as soon as the judge saw me .
so i went to the court .
sometimes i get too much .
and there are hundreds of them .
but , you know what ?
it &apos;s not our burden .
today it &apos;s 2.3 million .
i probably wouldn &apos;t do that .
i &apos;m going to stand with you something .
we use the energy of the sun .
the children don &apos;t make it .
i got some scared of technology .
the white lines are population .
but they do it .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
and it starts with a doctor .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
and once we started a live .
people still were happy .
it was my first sunburned .
actually , he gathered fish .
my name is brian goldman .
it &apos;s a different experience of others .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
i did it all .
and it &apos;s the crux .
but there are two problems in this .
i started feeling better .
but slowly , it turned out .
she was back and died .
and the nurse was standing .
my second mistake was worse .
that made me really sad .
and then something funny happened .
now this is one of the paintings .
i see this plusch .
and then , again , it showed him ja4 .
and we did that .
basically they do the same thing .
they come from the artists .
i shouldn &apos;t be saying that .
so i &apos;ll show you now .
these are all the metadata .
we went into a area .
the one place is south korea .
what other brands are doing ?
tell me about the world .
last technology .
this is very risky .
that would have been a problem at all .
the power plant can explode .
it &apos;s cool , right ?
i call them up .
and it worked very well .
this picture is from this place .
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
her mother alone she was leaving her .
but it &apos;s not going to do that fast .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us very much .
they connected these two people .
how do i get it away ? &quot;
and that &apos;s not something that &apos;s happening .
maybe even in our mobile phones .
how can we help you ? &quot;
we &apos;re going not further than that .
think about your own decisions .
no , never had a option .
the story is not over .
that &apos;s , quite simple .
what &apos;s going on that day ?
well , let &apos;s see .
okay , there &apos;s a couple .
they &apos;re all important opportunities . &quot;
and it was an incredible experience .
but there &apos;s another reason .
architects and engineers , fortunately .
so this was one of the things that i did .
next : nuclear energy .
it &apos;s a pretty crazy idea .
anyway , we need a solution .
among them , things like that , not suffer .
today , 6.8 billion people live today .
and this is really transformative to really change .
i was going to try something a little bit .
there are also world records .
and that can make a big difference .
and everybody in this room must be inside .
and that got me through ...
we have something that goes on .
dark urin . darkly .
music is medicine . music is causing us .
i loved this fish from this fish .
yes , they are the data .
how far will you get there ?
and then we said , okay .
it &apos;s just how we get .
so i just started playing .
this is ideology , not science .
i could draw . i could paint .
they were flowing the channels .
do they make that for the kids ? &quot;
a billion people are hungry today .
i &apos;m looking greg leaas .
so i stop hearing , thank you .
the result was catastrophic .
the names are projectritter .
who doesn &apos;t want to be a healer children ?
these are going to be miserable .
so this crazy story could be .
we &apos;ve been playing warcraft since 1994 .
students are divided to grades .
what about longevity ?
but what &apos;s going to be going on in the future ?
five million people are using it every month .
happy productivity . fantastic !
i remember my first fire .
and guess what i learned ?
it turns out it &apos;s really hard to get out .
do we really want to go in that direction ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
but it doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
so the natural thing is that the natural things were present .
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
what does a story set out ?
embarrassing . shell .
so , look what happens .
i &apos;m going back my sleeve .
and the goal here is very simple .
i think the knife in my hand .
it doesn &apos;t do science to do .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
so the correlation is lower .
no , i mean it really seriously .
we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
that &apos;s not necessarily bad .
it &apos;s dealing with waranity .
be cogi . &quot;
and then , automatically , he &apos;s going to be a right idea .
the question is , what &apos;s next ?
and the third one is foresever forgotten .
and that &apos;s really in the beginning .
i want to show you that .
but anyway , to navigate .
and on the book , and on the image .
let &apos;s make a little photo-eye-line .
for a long time than these two networks .
it &apos;s here to rise the sun .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s recognized .
anyone know what &apos;s next in three seconds ?
a really exciting phenomenon .
and what does it mean for designers ?
and it depends on phosphorus .
pretty much a knivor project .
this is completely smovelous .
we started 15 years ago .
sunlight and co2 are a way of wire .
you can do something from nothing .
a has got these benefits and risks .
and there are several reasons for this .
do you want to make any holes with holes ?
the truth is more like this .
people about urin .
fantastic ! this is a very noisy machine .
i think it &apos;s obvious .
these rivers are taking rapfold .
this is the memory of the memory .
this picture reminded me of something .
leave it forward .
it makes leukemia in children .
the living minds are the minds of the living .
i &apos;m something that comes out of my head .
no , no , no , no , no .
it &apos;s like learning .
and this sounds very different from that .
so the first step to show is an interpretation .
do you know what &apos;s left ?
you &apos;ve ever been arhaunted ?
because for me , it &apos;s remembering it .
that must be the balance difference .
the interest is the firelighter .
he signed up .
here you have this little mechanism .
and here &apos;s it .
these things are logical correctly .
and yet it &apos;s not a interpretation of the show .
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
as we think from northern india .
that &apos;s just the minimum .
so you can &apos;t solve this .
we can take our nutrients back .
but we need that all together .
but it &apos;s very effective , right ?
asking about what is the right thing ?
nullemissions , yes ?
and how did he feel ?
you can show , i was there .
if you come to that , right ?
we can reinvent everything again .
i started an institute .
the key reason to write it .
be just who you are .
we &apos;ve already run a lot of work .
it &apos;s a very sensitive question .
my brother dragged me .
this will be called public development .
many of my clients are very young .
these are the apsaras .
it can know where we are .
we don &apos;t really know about it much .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
i started my usual talk .
i learned this from my grandmother .
they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
we didn &apos;t have written this app .
and these are the neural structures .
oh , my time is already gone ?
they spread out .
they didn &apos;t give up government .
but that &apos;s what it &apos;s possibly possible .
now we &apos;re doing this with airplanes .
and they gave them an evolutionary advantage .
all these generations are just a few milliseconds .
i &apos;ve tried to understand them .
i think there &apos;s opportunities everywhere .
but it takes a lot of planning .
and his answer was , &quot; yes . &quot;
they sell certificates .
it &apos;s not going to be documented .
and nobody seems to arrest .
bjfine sundin .
it &apos;s about changing environment .
i &apos;m not taking the same process .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
privacy is not about debate .
lego made it possible for everybody .
they were genetically replaced .
the defeat was too simple .
i &apos;m the redefined doctor .
and she &apos;s purposing a 257 .
but i &apos;m going to ask you one question .
now look at this curve .
because we live on a water planet .
we all love baseball , right ?
we actually have redefined poverty .
the other one had had a huge arrangement .
they gave her blood pressure .
her family was gained .
why am i going to go to medicine ?
and every morning i jumped on it .
the game starts at -- silence .
who ever would want to wish ?
we are a smaller brand .
what are you going to describe in a ban ?
that was more to emphasize .
we need to think about what markers are .
what else is it risky ?
okay , you really want to know this ?
that made no sense in my mind .
hmmm , my brand ?
i really like nice clothes .
i like things that are different .
i went to jail -- it &apos;s hard .
the encounters are very good .
that &apos;s scary .
he can only use his eyes .
what do you do with that ? &quot;
you can do it all the time .
but the truth is far from it .
and this video is in real time .
the film wasn &apos;t issued .
this is a kindergarten , right ?
we won a few prices .
and i had to go out of the city .
that sounds horrifying .
thank you very much for your patience .
here you see roberto dancing .
oh my god . oh , my god .
who could have been able to have it all ?
here &apos;s a description of the road .
who are they actually trying to inform with it ?
we need to get up slowly .
here &apos;s the olive oil .
that &apos;s more than 250,000 of the day .
all the adults were aware of the risks .
something hidden in me .
we had a year for a year .
here &apos;s her march running .
her father died shortly after her .
they even get funding with them .
it seems to be absolutely popular .
it &apos;s supposed to be enforting the experience .
but thank you , but the best one is coming .
you see something fun here .
but then you really want to fall deep .
they want to be tempting in the museum ?
well , that &apos;s not exactly right .
and i &apos;ve never seen it .
this is a picture of the object .
so we measured his movement .
the stone is colored .
it was then the two elements .
there are many great books about this subject .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
so that &apos;s a tough niss .
so what do you do with that waste ?
and also , these sources are disruptive .
solther the fuel problem really .
is there not half or a quarter of it . &quot;
so what can we conclude from all of this ?
there &apos;s a few things that have to come together .
what measured i am going to do ?
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
that &apos;s just an insurance technique .
and even breathing , and even breathing .
it &apos;s been wasted far .
they &apos;re pulling the process , they understand it .
i am an expert on relationships . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; the best in the business . &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
the chef had checked him up .
they literally summed the lever .
there was never before a time like this .
they live with chemosynthesis .
i was totally confused .
he was shoving his head , no .
this is an ecological network .
how are they going to feed the world ? &quot;
it was really unmengeous .
you can predict the predictions . why is that ?
that will be going on next april in the next april .
so the first one was the first exciting prime .
that &apos;s the truth . i think that .
daniel kahneman : sure .
we get a completely flat line about this .
thank you , danny kahneman .
and there are a lot of staff staff .
i &apos;m not getting this feedback in real life .
he had 20 minutes of bad music .
everybody would like to make people happier .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
what do you think happens next ?
i &apos;ll tell you the post .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
thank you . i have a question for you .
we also have very precise data .
they have . they &apos;ve always got .
i must say , i don &apos;t understand that .
does anybody know what that is ?
it &apos;s not even the truth they &apos;re free .
we talk about twidoms of it .
the guy in the middle doesn &apos;t do that .
we now have a lot in this country .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
what &apos;s the picture ? pretty good .
we don &apos;t want consumers .
because we want to push around genes ?
so , it &apos;s here . right .
also , the dosage is played .
well , i &apos;ll show you .
i hope you &apos;ll show me .
a language is the characteristic of the human spirit .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
now , this sounds obvious to basically one .
and that &apos;s what they do .
this is an annual dial flow .
but we &apos;re starting to see a change .
this is one part of it .
it &apos;s about a new session of america .
we need to get far far , and it &apos;s fast .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
but that &apos;s where i &apos;m going to talk to you about .
no , no , no , dugger .
i want to explain that for a little time .
maybe again , a look at this .
so from modern , into computer society .
it just didn &apos;t get there , you know ?
you see the first time in front of the back .
yeah . it doesn &apos;t matter anything else than you do .
this is my supermarket . i &apos;m not big .
now this level of intuition becomes very important .
they are the home countries of someone .
156 nations send our tv channel .
our magazines are read by millions .
so let &apos;s pull out something different .
a dalmatiner , exactly .
we &apos;ve built unique elements here .
in other parts , the world of communication .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
they &apos;re all incurring questions .
you &apos;re doing worse there .
it &apos;s actually killing a little virus of bacteria .
so to say , what is information ?
they drilled each other .
the mechanism is from the lie .
behind the seven mountains , and so forth .
the thing that &apos;s been pressed right now .
basically a translation of translation .
this is a builder part .
especially when he died .
tell it what you feel .
so in two hours , they &apos;re building all over the place .
but with the right design , please .
a particularly nice story , i mean .
and then he can walk outside .
because now you can play a three-sentence .
three thirds of time you know that from school .
now , in this three-30s , three sentences are coming .
so these are two circles .
you make it a box .
and curiosity doesn &apos;t learn .
shame the environment , making less waste .
i see the dalmatiner .
it &apos;s got to process it as the present .
what does the fiftieth milliseconds ?
that &apos;s a kind of paradigm shift .
i try to take this through an example .
and on , now , you see it all over .
we can support them , to be good .
that &apos;s just a little less destruction .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
no tree is carbon neutral .
we can support them , to be good .
the side product is clean water .
wide-acits are just an end of our lives .
we &apos;ve seen some amazing presentations .
my cousins loves around .
so it creates a feedback back .
they were inspired by inspired .
it can know how we keep it .
the storytelling just practice more senses .
the next step was now within that community .
she was the daughter of slave family .
boston has not just a call center .
this country is different than a 40 years ago .
i teach people in death cells .
i think our identity is threatened .
she &apos;s deeply touching her .
leadership might take some mutations .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
something very strange happened here .
so i followed my gut instinct .
&quot; they left her not . &quot;
he moved back to silence .
he died , broken through the story .
i never met him in a way .
i lived in parallel worlds .
i learned a couple of very simple things .
we worked late at night .
so scott is getting this fruit .
i believed everybody could do that .
the bank is from a different place .
it may take me to be invited .
this is a modest little app .
do you want to come and listen ? &quot;
even cats look at this video .
she wasn &apos;t yet unfinished .
you lose ararary animals .
what you need is a new medical culture .
i am a human . i make mistakes .
it was a grouper .
they grow in five inches .
that &apos;s the system that we live in .
and the difference is that it &apos;s a loss .
but i kept asking myself to these questions .
but western governments help help themselves .
but today we are far beyond .
they tap their internet connection .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
sleep is ubiquitous .
he was uploaded all kinds of natural videos .
it &apos;s alone , and without support .
&quot; risk is not a simple game .
what are these three billion people who are going to bring them ?
you should have your wish .
i &apos;d written this crazy thing .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
notice two things about this curve .
i &apos;m going to be tired of all of us .
&quot; a pale blue dot . &quot;
and that &apos;s what i felt .
so , this has been a problem for supercomputers .
we expect some remarkable decades .
baseball is filled with great statistics .
maybe i did it with good reason .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of this .
we can give ourselves something .
there came jimmy kimmel .
here &apos;s how the building works .
and that was the outbreak .
and anyway , italy won the end .
you see the timeline .
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
the roof was also covered with water .
it &apos;s called &quot; leap . &quot;
as an artist , i &apos;m really important to the relationship .
i call this the bearing tiger .
mt is completely paralyzed today .
normal people are not accessible . &quot;
no insurance can be able to make .
so thank you very much . that was incredible .
let &apos;s start with the environmental sense .
make it possible -- they all here .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
we &apos;ll be back to these guys later .
in many cases , these people are perfectly healthy .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
the main man floating me .
look at what she &apos;s doing .
but the game is a form developer .
this is a painting of a circly .
we don &apos;t quite know why this is happening .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
they had a concept of blue blood .
and women were arguing that .
the conditions of this species exist there at us .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
it &apos;s all from our pockets .
sexual reproduction goes into the picture .
i have him on my laptop . &quot;
and i want to read you that .
let &apos;s think about atoms .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
all of you applaud .
i &apos;m going to negotiate directly with the artist .
now we saw the reverse effect .
they brought their pictures with me , right ?
now , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
third technology : categorization .
here are two different jeghts .
actually , not to do any viral video .
you can be logical and intuitively .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
tell me a little bit about that part .
i am a redundant person .
so ... meaning not so optimistic .
that &apos;s usually not the route .
he switches the plants .
completely considered , directly , targeted .
this is actually actually the workplace .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the goal of the film is transparency .
how would you describe your brand ?
no , that was what i thought .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
a whole dish shot .
we talk about the kitchen , fresh .
so littlive &apos;s height .
you can come in in a certain year .
you can jump directly to a certain execution .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
what is the food supply ? &quot;
every morning they fly 240 kilometers from the farm every morning .
and every night you &apos;re going to fly 240 miles .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
astonishing , he still was delicious .
it kind of got us wired .
i &apos;m going to choose the issue of government .
we talk about the drowdroin information .
i was absolutely a grateful , you know .
i didn &apos;t get to unhelow .
so , that really blew me .
and green-oculously , it was a catastrophe .
this has to be down here , towards zero .
you say there &apos;s no predictor .
we have already managed 20 percent in germany .
now , the instruments have evolved .
picasso says , wait for just one .
so it &apos;s going to be coming to the human outcomes .
i got it up especially .
these sentences are absolutely rational and correct .
if you burn coal : no .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put on .
and yes , i &apos;ll go back and find a slide again .
and then it &apos;s usually like this .
so we just wanted it to be like , okay .
and nobody has done this one on the planet .
and then , you can react again with others again .
it &apos;s the most powerful human trait .
his personal impressions of the segses .
what ? that was really freak .
i &apos;m really sorry . does that make you crazy ?
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
we got rid of what wasn &apos;t working .
you know , science is not a company .
it &apos;s kind of like a potatto .
sitting behind the back , somebody who had no childhood .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
and they &apos;re not just going to die on mass .
let me show you about close .
now , normally i would take the needle out .
there &apos;s a lot of fortune coaching .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
thank you very much for the invention of the behavioral economics .
it &apos;s a million people .
so , just help me do a little bit .
they don &apos;t invest in power .
what do you think happened with these design students ?
the internet and the services and the services is a miracle .
and there &apos;s the excess problem .
that will be a key element of this aceral .
we need to apply for more research .
you hope that we don &apos;t need it .
if you burn natural gas : no .
well , i understand that . i do that .
let &apos;s have a machine like that here .
my parents are the 80 to the ferhes .
we forced them . pop .
they were just like the people in this room .
what happened is we could do that .
can you be playing me in blue ?
we run through the initiational rituals .
do you remember the winl before ?
seriously -- the underway goes up !
yeah , i scared about all of these things .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
it becomes a challenge to offer for nine .
this is the machine under genezz .
and they had to remove what we did .
they &apos;re all coming back on your way .
we just signed out .
they laughed over it more than she did .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
it &apos;s been rolling over the land on them .
if you &apos;re not , anybody else .
and that &apos;s great because we need that .
your job is to dance , you &apos;re going to dance .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
the ice ice is marked with red .
we don &apos;t get identity ; we invent it .
but here &apos;s what they should have thought .
and the problem is not technology .
but these are all streets in the u.s.
many of them are covered by faces and so on .
the official dogma of what ?
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
the hydrogen has bigger .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask all of the questions .
so here &apos;s a couple on the hamptons .
i could go right before my house . &quot;
now this cartoon makes some statements .
third : escalation is the expectation .
your problem is they have too little .
and if it &apos;s not , even the aaves , even your dance .
you just hear and start talking .
because that is what happens , right ?
or take a lip .
and there &apos;s a central point to this .
the phosphorus problem is much critical .
shame the environment , use less energy .
and everything is packaging or content .
it &apos;s going to be compared to china in a second .
this is what we call osit-model model .
it &apos;s more like the norm .
imagine mozart efficient .
there &apos;s a footprint on it .
for example , the sneak , right ?
no , we find what &apos;s inside .
it &apos;s all that inside is useful .
you &apos;ve got a cake .
all of it is compotilible .
and you can continue the list endlessly .
so what are the archatic models ?
i start with some simple examples .
now i add a bass down .
now i &apos;m going to do a little bit of stuff .
i &apos;m very happy to know that i &apos;m there .
so , that was my primary motivation .
valuation america . find out that you find more .
now you &apos;re going to see the dalmatinan .
and the two one is also here today .
anyway , that you do it in this .
at the beginning , the tribal society is through the language .
that the theme of ecology is a global environment .
now , everyone &apos;s trying to recognize something from this pattern .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
next week , it comes into the market .
we &apos;ve been wondering , and nobody did .
and he does keep a realistic level .
is this about the details or colors ?
and then , it &apos;s about the combination of the different images .
and here is every piece very good .
she has a button on the wheel .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
and my mother would go after a few minutes .
i work in the solar technology industry .
there &apos;s a lot of people today .
scott talked about being human .
that we have the contribution to the system that &apos;s going to be choosing .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
but it has an unexpected turn .
and try and try with another generation .
motors , salmon -- four possibilities .
well , it was friday , that &apos;s right .
the rest of the time is delalized .
it &apos;s got to be fine a thousand square kilometers .
so , the theme of the day : financial saving .
i think i may have heard more hands .
my fourth technology : prediction of complexity .
we &apos;re in the middle of this transition .
life had not changed for centuries .
no one has to give your ideas green .
my grandmother never let me let me let my life let me live .
but as many people have been over for the years .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
there had to be another piece of paper .
all those who were , started to divide .
this would be somebody who &apos;s totally intuitive .
it &apos;s a game that &apos;s called a talent .
and this is very important in medical research .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for this .
and we keep expecting our expectations constantly .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and silicon .
we &apos;re thinking about energy scarcity .
i call them the coming billion .
there &apos;s a chance to do something .
well , i walked into the courthouse .
it &apos;s the average performance of the bat .
do you know how to call a 400th call ?
i made them and made me go for the treatment .
i remember it as it was yesterday .
and i got back to work .
what would you tell to somebody who believes that ?
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there &apos;s a few highly interesting things .
we are always creating new tensions and conflicts .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
first of all , i thought that was a game .
i said , &quot; okay , grandmother . &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
but we seem to feel satisfied .
at 16 , i started illuching books .
and i have to say , there was power .
we want to do something about the death penalty .
i learned very simple things in my work .
then i ask myself : how could this happen ?
he came up to me and hugbleed me .
then he tagged me in the ear .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a particle .
that &apos;s a problem that many of the people have .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about .
so we have this awful simplification idea .
i &apos;m not sure where we &apos;re going .
ladies and gentlemen , their relationships .
so two pairs , each one &apos;s a baby .
imagine just for a moment .
interreligion is coming in many different forms .
they are in the back of your body .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
that &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
so i think we have to be leadership .
monday : paint is slightly powerful .
thursday : self-confidence is key .
and i &apos;ll summarize that for a second .
it &apos;s got a four years ago in italy .
so they go on ; saving the shoes .
but the reality is always unpredictable .
and of course , it &apos;s been hitting .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
people were left . people were fought .
what we want is to create the future .
and i claim that this is good .
maybe we can see wide-alities as a change .
it was summer , and i had moms .
i want to show you something first of all .
it &apos;s just the test of survival and success .
come with me . thank you very much .
raise your hands . let me see .
we &apos;ve been here for about 130,000 years .
i &apos;ve tried to keep the body .
i wanted to restore health for disease .
the summer was happier summer -- 2006 .
but it definitely is not an opmal situation .
eeeee ! no , thank you .
the first is a classic , apple .
actually , no , that wasn &apos;t the mistake at all .
and those things have a positive effect .
you should tell me something about my brand .
man 3 : i &apos;m the godber .
it &apos;s like i want to be .
what do you think the answer is ?
it just has to spread as far as possible .
he &apos;s not come out in other countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demands .
you come to two ways -- very simple .
you &apos;re walking around and choosing .
you can actually put in very easily and push out .
no one wanted to do anything with the film .
but the best one is still -- in a second .
it was something we knew .
imagine a plane full of it .
something is called something in the city .
on the left-hand side , you see a little boat .
so they communicate -- they &apos;re running along .
so i was so researching a couple months later at a conference .
and we need a lot to make progress on this machine .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
and so what i &apos;m telling you is very important .
i never want to do anything else in life .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
so this made sense , which made it .
so again , the fit fit really well .
so this is where we need to have digital security systems .
the three words are like , do you remember ?
what do you do with certifices ?
this is alfred gonzalez .
so they &apos;re not able to put them together .
let me show you how they work .
it &apos;s not a choice between private and safety .
and that argument is not a point .
the emergence staff moved all the strands .
it was much more , and i got in hurry .
it can give a sequence of changes .
i thought i could integrate myself .
we &apos;re still thinking , they &apos;re originally .
it &apos;s supportive when others are talking about their mistakes .
and we want to make this material available for all available .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
probably one of these numbers needs to come very close to zero .
so that was a really curious experience .
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going to come out ? &quot;
these blocks of stuff don &apos;t kill us .
there &apos;s a link , a mutual respect .
i think first it &apos;s the curiosity .
and i found that incredibly interesting .
so , actually , my two lovaons went through .
i &apos;ve summarized the last three of five .
in each one of these five areas we need at least 100 people .
the sales for hundreds of years .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
many talk about an 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
and so i then met a little unusual decision .
the main issue here is to be like aids .
for nathaniel , music is kelmaterness health .
i had a relationship with a couple of months with this beauty .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have more ?
these were the very first calculations of six years ago .
so it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
natural light then offers smart-grid .
now , fortunately , there are a whole lot of studies .
marshmallow has to be on top .
you make something a little bit different .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can do it .
they have reversed the flow of water .
i mean , they &apos;ve never seen this .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
it &apos;s really very important that we get there .
we can continue to do these things around different examples .
... that &apos;s also the dosage of dosage .
but now , i can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
that investment in africa over the last 30 years .
you don &apos;t need it , and we &apos;re not giving it .
and why ? more changed food .
anyway . i mean , i &apos;m going to do it .
probably many of you probably know here in the room this is the guy .
yes , they are right . fix this .
we don &apos;t want businesses to patent .
the people in the side of the way come in .
but one of them is far worse than the other .
and you say , what happens to these moments ?
there seems to be a disagreement .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
it &apos;s right to patent , patent , patent crack .
actually we know that something else is the case .
and i took a while to find it .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
now they understood the advantage of the project prototyping .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i need to say .
my grandparents brought this number to 70d.
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
but do you know what they &apos;re not right ?
i thought , let &apos;s bring the poker .
and some of it worked , and it doesn &apos;t work for some .
and why ? because paul has made a vaccine .
have you taken all of your vitamins this morning ?
so we &apos;re going to walk out and where we go ?
and i have all kinds of little props here .
there were no cantaloucs mellons .
because actually this man is not interested in the evidence .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re bringing kids to the world .
the logic doesn &apos;t matter about reality .
we wanted to design a learning tool for adolance .
now he &apos;s got a tractor to get the scene .
they were all in the news .
the fact is , coal is not fildirty .
and you also feel your movements and tilt .
here are some more people who test it .
so , for him , they were just building bries .
i may have another 40 of the years of working in me .
so we went about 50 of the magnet .
i can see the sequence while they &apos;re running away .
so yeah , so what should biohacking be ?
now this is actually not a joke , but it &apos;s actually not a joke .
now , what do we actually do for projects we &apos;re doing now ?
they &apos;re generating reality , and it &apos;s not without computers .
this is an entirely unstoppable phenomenon .
and in that head , the memory was up .
you know what the answer to that question is ?
and we often kind of invent the way we want .
every major picture is the beginning of a section .
there are those who are a lot of spatial .
and we can navigate on this very simple way .
i &apos;m very thankful for the reception here .
if you want to , you want to make hyperlinks between the images .
so , if you keep a little bit of a slip .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
and the world that we lived on .
everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is gone .
i wear jeans , almost all the time .
but let &apos;s not always leave that one thing .
this is a footage of six seconds .
the only thing they had was her head .
we dance in the temple , and they become to god . &quot;
talk is barely speaking about interpretation .
making your own breath .
in the countries where people are coming to money .
it &apos;s kind of like using a behavior poop .
have a nice example of that .
and in my youth , i said , i was expectations .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
it &apos;s the same way that we have it .
but today we &apos;re talking about the biological systems .
but maybe you can also vote them .
why have i have a car like that .
it &apos;s just densing them and not self-even .
because we can &apos;t live without that lifelings .
so we can &apos;t really do these things .
all around the wind is all about .
do that , and then you learn your sentence .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
that means we need to get phosphorus back .
and this is a game , i have to say .
we &apos;ve understood that the weather is global .
and so what about that actually ?
information is any difference , any difference .
i don &apos;t know who you know this picture .
what we &apos;ve left is the &quot; novel &quot; .
not all of you would be committed .
and we see that it &apos;s going through this underway .
but you can &apos;t replace the phosphorus .
if you fall in love with somebody , you ?
i say , heart , sorry , yes ?
so , saving , avoiding , avoiding .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
but what happened to &quot; elities &quot; is different .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
today i &apos;m going to report from unexpected discoveries .
al is a hydrant in the city of boston .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
this is the call center for service and information .
and that worked . applaudlessly , applaud .
we have all the navigation systems in our cars .
i put my job with 95 knlos .
good night , sweet thylacaters . &quot;
and we use this word with such contempt .
people seem to think , well , politics is sexy .
... could you just show the slide .
the transition happens . we can feel it .
and we want to put that in a global scale .
the coverage of the dna was an interesting step .
i was not really familiar with the eticle .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wame .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
in 2010 , it was 23 million times .
and all of this leads us to the big question .
no apple ever shocked again .
my mother suffered from the boat from the boat .
keep that off , weigging the rest .
the underwater bit comes from a quarter .
i would not tell my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
i met the decision to raise the u.s.
so i think the essence are very simple .
and let me show you a simple example .
but at the same time , we know that it &apos;s not possible .
so every piplet a little bit differently .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
there &apos;s a program that some might have seen .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
thank you for being at ted . thank you .
child mortality has reduced a tenh .
that &apos;s moore &apos;s law of the last hundred years .
so growth is accelerating itself .
and we &apos;ve also seen this in mobile phones .
and i went over and i just stopped .
and i said , &quot; yeah , i love . &quot;
we have the passion of a diy innovators .
well , really good , maybe a single star .
i was a forced of obsessed .
and give feedback to my head doctor .
and it wasn &apos;t a hard diagnosis .
we want to recreate mass inheritings . &quot;
we &apos;re far far away from that goal .
you can say things things that have the world &apos;s population .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
and yet , we understand the options yet not yet .
now we &apos;re doing this with drill and machines .
and i &apos;m a character that comes from the book .
this kid in me is really thrilled .
it &apos;s also in other places in the book .
tell me , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
it seems to me that i think both contributors .
she had the last word in every family fight .
i remember it just like it was yesterday .
it influences , not debt , it influenced the outcome .
silence is the silence .
the death penalty question is an interesting question .
because it doesn &apos;t affect the appropriate money .
that &apos;s not how happy a person is living .
okay , let me show you a little bit more of it .
we see the same thing in the dispersled movement .
but how do you do that in practice ?
but will we make the best of our play toss ?
they &apos;re both survival , both of them .
and it &apos;s not just about sexual sex .
we see that in all sorts of different areas of human life .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature .
the dog ! i was speaking about that .
as i said , amanda is our election .
tuesday : adaptation is totally overwhelmed .
i have something i want to show you .
second is the second half of the normal days .
here are the results we have right now .
so they can track all the movement .
learning and the rules of the game .
this is something we do our competition .
8,000 gaming playing the game 8 weeks .
see , dr. kean has changed his thinking .
we have a total and a half billion players .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
i just do agree , that &apos;s logical .
same , i think , today , today .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the balls .
so , just imagine two other little changes .
and so then it was after three months .
do you want to be attractive and more confident ?
how about living with good health ?
i want to do it by not dying . &quot;
how could it be possible that we do this ?
every iciceberg has its own individual personality .
this is a little bit of a sec victle .
and that &apos;s what these brands did .
and what was that for her ? what it succeeds ?
these are the people who are creating my worldview .
what is next about the next story you want to talk about .
a little bit more about you , not you .
so there were a lot of crazy things happening .
or are they more like a down-attribute ?
all right , well , what is the brand gerry ?
and this is a million-dollar concentives .
this is just online -- no television , no television .
we should be surprised in the cage .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
here we are , and this is the painting .
and that was a experience in humility .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
we found that it actually moves really strange .
but otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
you know how many people are going to see this tedtalks ?
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
and this is the planning behind student student .
i want to tell you how we &apos;ve figured it out .
and these results were accomplished by several weeks .
it &apos;s natance and it &apos;s just natance .
i learned that in a moment , everything else is different .
i want to help you calm .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
it was &quot; in everness , forever . &quot;
the answer will probably be , &quot; no . &quot;
they were absolutely not trying to do anything about the project .
so how do we get in the movie of the movie ?
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the need for the assistance .
you don &apos;t lose a very common dose of animals .
if you generated it , what happens .
in our own countries , we would never do that .
the question is , why people accept the accepting .
and they &apos;re going to be less than that .
and therefore it &apos;s not a big loss .
she hardly breathed and was blue .
that &apos;s exactly what we want to do .
this is the kind of teacher shame .
this is a dead turtle .
you know , he was in 1835 .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
and i thought he had kidnastor chones .
the headheadquarters are right here .
so , a climate change is terrible for them .
also , the power rate is very important for them .
i was a failure right by studying the deep sea .
we went back to the wreckth of the titanic .
i learned a lot over this process .
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t give you a limita yourself .
you have to be willing to take those risks .
i was constantly , as a child , i recorded comicbooks and stuff .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website .
the second factor is the services we use .
so here are some natural light flies .
that &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy .
&quot; manhattan project ? how do we get to the target ?
where &apos;s the biggest interest , what &apos;s really going to work on ?
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know .
there are other innovative companies in the nuclear sector .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
so i was skaned a lot of fish in my life .
the first two sentences , which are logical correctly .
the logic doesn &apos;t matter about what &apos;s true .
so if sound says there are no soul .
so smart-grid , giant topic everywhere .
and that &apos;s &apos; n king .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
but for a lot of people , it &apos;s a little too radical .
so you could feel like it was selling him .
it &apos;s hard to overcast the destruction .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
&quot; look at your bites , pink .
the flininines eat the shrimp .
bg : one energy breakthrough is the most important one .
this is the idea of how the soul works .
i mean , i &apos;ve rarely seen such flat lines .
the more money you make is happier .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
and here are two patients . these are your records .
the biggest difference between them is the deal of time .
that &apos;s not how it works at all for the rememberer .
the life itself has no voice in that option .
this is my flesh , and i can rotate it .
i take away this hand . and here &apos;s the knife .
we spend three billion hours a week at the same time playing online games .
this is one of the classical expressions in play .
you never get a task they can &apos;t solve .
this constant feedback isn &apos;t in the real life .
you &apos;re supposed to be an additional number of player a nearby number .
i mean , this is a real cognitive case .
and yet , you work much less than i did .
we did it in the last 11,000 years .
we reject ususrarically .
because they have special skills of the process of processing .
we repeated this exercise with the same students .
we had not been a child hill in this country .
we &apos;re running into the arms of the placebo industry .
they go to the tunabo mbeki in south africa .
1m is the highest thing i saw .
i &apos;m just going to hold the knife just like this .
and you know what my answer to all this is ?
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
now maniok is something that a half billion people eat .
you wouldn &apos;t go to starve , and you know what ?
i &apos;ll do it for you and explain it to you .
this is actually the hardest part of my talk .
grandfather of this ancient man refused .
but artists have a crowd relationship to lying .
so don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
clean coal , they &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
i &apos;m going to write on , because that &apos;s my job .
if we start thinking about it , it changes everything .
and ololé ! well for you , for all this .
it grows in the winter and shrink in the summer .
but the volume are much bigger than ever before .
his whole job of jobs changed .
everybody knew , you know , your genius was a little bit .
and those interactive portraits are true .
this is an interactive march manage .
i &apos;m very excited to speak to you all .
as i said , two-year peace-four .
and the third area , which is actually explaining to itself .
not only bad , but the worst of all times .
and then you &apos;ll notice that it &apos;s been going to change .
they don &apos;t know anything in that goldfish glass . &quot;
our steps to digitize of life were exponentially .
they get a model that comes out of the whole earth .
and it &apos;s also rooted in our lives .
and the world that we now live in now is like this .
and the question is , are the good or bad news ?
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
from the vog age to machine age .
and everybody knew that it was so functional , right ?
you may have heard that we &apos;ve built watersigns .
we were trying to get to the point of automation .
we &apos;re now focusing on green cells .
we replaced them , repair them .
i &apos;d rather keep doing that work that i love .
they didn &apos;t have any local toy .
we had to worry about the lawyers and so on .
in fact , the notes are very vust and unfair .
so every concert is different concerts .
we &apos;ve been using now over three years now .
no , throw away the right thing , right ?
it &apos;s a form of red-behaviors , right ?
because we don &apos;t do things more freely .
hey , puma , you &apos;re really serious ?
that means the ants are a lot more than we do .
one baby needs about six thousand degrees of windmill .
i will never play as much as that moment .
i can &apos;t play this today as i am in 20 years .
and then you shame and said , like , what ?
or b , because they haven &apos;t learned to sing ?
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
there is no overpopulation problem of trees .
so please , please join me , if a music is playing .
every society is shaped by a prite medium .
so how do we do that , if we look in this ?
another example is what is called virtual reality .
these are the spaces that are rational to a human being .
and we want to look at this now .
i &apos;m also going to resolve what &apos;s inside .
a research mester on the theme of natural use design .
we &apos;ve used to ourselves that things happen .
that &apos;s why the weigh of the matter .
it &apos;s going to be more like my glasses .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s like .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know , as a designer .
how can i make a possible user service ?
and less usual or us-friendly is it .
as a result , we build more powerful social relationships .
so he got the citizens to test them .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
and i see the same process in combination of pictures .
we know one thing , wherever there &apos;s stainary stations .
the next step was to find the apps .
and we put an ipad app .
&quot; not &quot; revolved &quot; itself .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
daren and sponsorors were looking for .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the thylacaise .
that &apos;s great . this is where the digital is the physical .
so the occupation of the movement has done it .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about .
when i say reality , i mean a little bit reality .
stem communities started abstracting information .
i didn &apos;t know how to use it .
i want to talk about the problem and talk about some possible solutions .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
so , let me give you an analogy .
the faces of the audience were very serious and pleasmenting .
also , urban designer and farmer are very interested .
this is an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
and this was the brain , and the nervous system of the communities .
they had 348 different kinds of marpenade .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
it was looked at almost 200 million times this year .
but what about this day , this particular day ?
this year , it looked at almost 50 million times .
it &apos;s a puzzle that will still be put together .
and the next interesting stage took about one billion years .
i don &apos;t see why it shouldn &apos;t be that way .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
he described one of them as a very &quot; normal . &quot;
both cases were standing to me , asking me .
it &apos;s a completely denial of failure .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i do things not the same .
all of this stuff is unavoidable .
thirty years ago that would have been ridiculous .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of them . &quot;
now , on the red list , he &apos;s on top of the top list .
we didn &apos;t have any words for what we started .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
well , how do people die in a course of a catch ?
and she said the three words : do you get yourself ?
another favorite picture of me , annid .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
in one place , the screen will fit with leaves .
i said , &quot; promise , oma . &quot;
so in other words , i &apos;m actually most saying what i want .
it &apos;s compromising and weird programs .
but i really believe that after us comes something .
here it says , &quot; make your fingers on every light . &quot;
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
the only thing was that they had 10 children .
i think it &apos;s true for every human on the planet .
we just alstied around there like nothing .
and of course , it can never give you more in germany .
so these women got and stopped and they just stopped .
we want to reduce the number of carbons .
and you can see this green dot there in the middle .
and these were sort of the first developed machine machine .
you zoom in . you can actually go inside .
how are you judglate people from their characteristics ?
inhablday : hug your child &apos;s child .
so a lot of testosterone , but no reaction to it .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s been raised as a girl .
so gender can come in many different varieties .
they were moving into a natural concept .
well , chimpanzees are famous for their aggressive .
you can almost always look for less than 50 dollars .
if you have something to give , you &apos;ll give it .
france makes a leaf . ity does a leaf .
dandane , in a moment of headlop .
well , we know all about where we are getting from .
well , we presented the mayor belhole .
play is the tickle that &apos;s holding us together .
you can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
and no , it &apos;s not solthoc or san francisco .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open toors ?
how would you be better than you &apos;re currently at the moment ?
they shared the kingdom in two .
so i say , let &apos;s start the world &apos;s transformative games !
antonym : healthy , stronger , powerful .
here &apos;s the updated version of this site .
well the next day we were in cleveland .
they teach them to open themselves up .
it steel every five of a minute of my mind .
how many would you take memory for a good memory ?
or is it , or do it hurt us ?
this is another view of life .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to evolve .
we called it the digital water pavilion .
it was an extreme situation . it took it an extreme solution .
next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with this .
and the film is going to be the the the the the the the the the the
and then we give one of these great blows .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
i &apos;m selling the voyroom of the entire country .
there are some places we can turn towards .
what other metal ear gene are going through ?
they lie in the united states , in europe and japan .
or are they more like a down-attribute ?
are you eight days and monpos like am7 ?
it &apos;s not even online . it &apos;s no longer stretch .
emc presents transparency &quot; they welcome transparency &quot;
but what this image is is , it &apos;s a problem .
you can see in all these museums around all of these museums .
how much money is required to do this ?
we don &apos;t want iran to make the bomb .
and if it wasn &apos;t , it doesn &apos;t work .
he says , &quot; willware to the pringle &quot; ?
i said , &quot; please fly into the air . &quot;
and in the world , everyone makes sense to me .
how would you change their relationships and your negative energy in it ?
imagine a sound plane .
so we start with a winking drug .
that &apos;s the consequence we have to face .
we &apos;re talking about this -- about 15,000 lines of code .
well , in this region there is not many thousand goals .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and aggressive .
think about it . that attack is generally communal .
so , attract them and start inventing .
now , where do we go ? what &apos;s the right approach ?
what we need is a lot of companies working on it . hundreds of them .
and it was an experience that had not give me that hollywood .
so that got me upset , and i wanted to go .
and so my way of doing films changed , completely .
well , the energy rate is like that .
in fact , the progression of energy is on energy .
we will show it in the opening sequence of the film .
so i go back and forth the perspective .
here &apos;s a picture of a garden in kentucky .
a very concrete desire that we &apos;re inventing this technology .
this is a variant of one thing that was made .
the fact is that we should make that uncertainty .
so for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
this was not a movie , no hd , that was real .
my great-grandparents died when they were 60 .
it &apos;s this lovely , it &apos;s coordinated taste .
i mentioned to miguel , and he did .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta la palma .
i wasn &apos;t long time with miguel .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
so the one that the chas the one actually gets the system better . &quot;
so there was better a nine at the beginning of my death .
you can get a pivot in a decade .
he said , &quot; the skin acts like a sponge .
the system is as healthy ; it cleans water .
this is not a commercial , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
because they are the ones who are experts that are experts .
and i see a different pattern immediately that &apos;s available .
that &apos;s how much of it was under the same , bad team of under the best .
he &apos;s got a forgo waste from 15 to one .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
well , their life itself is not going to become happier .
i know what people think when you see that .
i hope you &apos;ll enjoy you . thank you very much .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds about their pain .
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean , how much we do we need of our memories ?
you can introduce your friends and neighbors . thank you .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i &apos;m clarified .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successfully , although it &apos;s that .
how can we cross-change these feelings into reality ?
ok , imagine what an extreme motivation approach .
players are a lot more social networks poet more social networks .
edward camatiova is a demographic scientist .
but it turns out that it &apos;s not all about that .
and so it &apos;s flowing up his eldering states .
that &apos;s great . i love the placebo industry .
this is an idiotic debate . it has to stop .
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s face .
you can just name some names and people will understand .
i mean , you can choose your own list .
ask you , ask for evidence , ask them .
that &apos;s a lot of deaths from masks , 20 per hour .
diphula , rotns , child paralysis ...
we can put this time machine in everything we want .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
you know , there was no mandarins in paradise .
and then people could eat this food and wouldn &apos;t be blind .
i mean , let &apos;s ask : why are we fighting this ?
there is no other description of what &apos;s happening here .
i said , &quot; chickie pellets ? &quot;
the ethnosphere is the great legacy of humanity .
bruno giusani : thank you . thank you .
you &apos;re looking at someone who &apos;s shining the sun .
i &apos;m not good enough ; i don &apos;t get a lot .
it &apos;s also my big , life-long love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that to change .
like algae -- and other unfrightening things .
please follow me because the circle will come again .
so the people in the west thought about creativity .
it &apos;s just breathtaking , very vigating .
this is an organism that we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
go and quin leonard lehen .
and all of a sudden , he didn &apos;t really see it more convenient .
25 years , it &apos;s gone from here to here .
this is 2020 feet of sea altitude , as greenland .
and the predictions as they read it are serious .
it generated tremendous justine in the control room .
gsty , the carbon will be clean every day .
they have to admit that this is a big choice .
one consequence was that the phone had never broken .
and if , i &apos;m going to find some of the weird ones .
somewhere else , there are a series of photographs -- here they are .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . hearteyed .
i just want to say a little bit about salatd-like apsing .
if you want to get far , go together . &quot;
that &apos;s the publicability we &apos;ve only done recently .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
why do they take care of us , if we can &apos;t buy ?
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and edever there is a political argument in our country .
or other models , or even technical specification .
and also , what they thought in the spirit of mind today .
i have a friend who &apos;s driving a serseri .
everything that is beautiful in life is not efficient .
because you know , it &apos;s a fun process .
he lived only in nine-three years .
the music standards is that this is the extension of our bodies .
it &apos;s not just a nice noise .
that means that they go back .
you &apos;ve ever seen a cliator .
and then immediately , it occurred to me , that &apos;s unfair .
and she asked him , what is your hobby ?
i can say the kanzi is a man .
but it wasn &apos;t like that in the avitieth century .
yeah , it &apos;s a burden that &apos;s down there .
that &apos;s not enough efficiency , it &apos;s effective .
and then we made a whole bunch of simulation .
it used to be like the beginning of the village .
and of course , it also is creation effect on perception .
that &apos;s a relatively substantial number of people around the world .
so i know some of them who didn &apos;t have intervened .
and today we &apos;re still on a very , very strong story .
this is what &apos;s happened so gene-called machines .
we have an abstract language of abstract language .
and i think technology is increasingly going to be more important in our modern societies .
so that &apos;s them all in the field of moving .
that &apos;s exactly the same thing i &apos;ve described .
that &apos;s the period where you fall in love .
so what does a human deal with a certain variation is how to deal with .
we can of course look at the waste of money .
and because we get older , the wind is getting bigger .
and that &apos;s from an economist . so he &apos;s logical .
this is a really extraordinary honor to me .
she was a tailtrack , a strong woman , she had an effect .
indeed , we are such a multi-cellular community .
the invention of language was a little step in that direction .
we see the process that self-self-feed itself .
so , in a sense , we &apos;re kind of wrestling us through technology .
and the lighting path through the rest of the book .
a government is absolutely critical , but it has to get more efficient .
let &apos;s call the animal vessel , it costs a lot of money .
my grandmother was very strong , but she was loving .
my grandfather was in prison during prohibition .
my uncle died in alcohol induts .
i &apos;ve tried to say something about our precise behavior .
an amazing error rate . one in nine unguashes .
what is this new state that &apos;s going to take the world evolving ?
and yet there &apos;s this mental reclaimation .
but , you can combine something special , but can you create something special .
secondly , combined images , you should have the same ill-propulsion .
&quot; because she &apos;s heard her for this morning , &quot; he said .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with them .
but what is the trick that does it look as it makes it look .
it &apos;s really about combine different realities .
and you can see these aren &apos;t three special images .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go wrong against injustice . &quot;
when a neighbor helps another , we will strength our communities .
i &apos;ll start with a sketch , an idea .
and yes , i have a job , as you might know .
it &apos;s a crowdsourcing .
here &apos;s a quick video of what we do .
thylacesses ? yes . alive ?
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death penalty .
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
she didn &apos;t suffer a vacmental brain damage .
and that was the first time i found this myself .
we have the capital of techno-philropes .
this is somebody who &apos;s in the rest of it possibly is four out of 10 .
and the very long time , i was going over more and more .
i studied emaxes and she was in breathless .
they were chasing them with the curding machine .
it &apos;s been developed at the university of washington in seattle .
what are you going to consume ? what will they get ?
in both cases , operiated and they were doing great .
they still describe them as being touched .
and the fish also had the luck to be there .
i know now that it was the ocean &apos;s cause .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them well .
and we can predict the structure and function .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzle .
and i thought this was going to be so hard .
10 minutes later , the judge announced a pause .
sometimes i get to get the balance . a story to the end .
right , bryan , the judge has magic .
i had a five-year-old boy , poor black boys than the mandaons .
a few months went along , and i just forgot .
i got into the car and i was really overwhelmed with it -- overwhelmed .
even anyone who kills anyone is not just a murderer .
in 2010 we were just connected to two billion people online .
that we have survival , all of us survive with survival of each individual .
it was the misguided cross race against drugs .
it turns out to none of our big problems .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
he took a famous photo . how did it mean ?
and the more i tell you , the more i should tell .
we need to start turning the real world into a game .
it was completely exclused that it could fail .
very rare is actually in contact with a rolling iceberg .
since that time , we &apos;ve got all sorts of recognition .
but we only know about where things go .
we can do the same things in which we can do the same things with less energy .
but actually that was another better fun that night .
imagine these spots really start to fly .
they &apos;re also interacting with their environment and their experiences .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit into my tiny suitcase .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody in this audience .
today i want to tell you about roels and revelations .
one of my friends did it -- richard bollingoucents .
and i celebrate , i cry like a little child .
so we should soon find out what the goal is .
the idea is to overload digital security system .
if we put cities , it &apos;s actually a big deal .
i &apos;ve been working on a carbon mine -- dangerous .
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
only that i think it &apos;s more like that , right ?
or do it , or do it a fitter , more powerful , more power .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
can you imagine a good good thing that comes from tobacco ?
these are the kinds of questions we need to be facing .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
i photographed in war -- difficult and dangerous .
i smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
in other words , play is our adaptmaker .
when the child is born , it looks like a girl .
i &apos;m jessi , and this is my suitcase .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look good .
you &apos;re happy , you go into other happy people .
you could also use the usual worm-technology technology .
and i can tell you , it was a transformational experience .
there &apos;s more about this , there &apos;s even deeper .
and each of these stattions , of course , was made of lots of small-making decisions .
for example , that person who is completely logical .
well , i &apos;m playing with them sometimes , but not very often .
but my hingent side didn &apos;t mean it .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
that &apos;s the piece of metal i &apos;m going to talk about .
there are many more , but i don &apos;t have time .
this is a stlight night , never seen before .
50 percent of their decisions were hit within nine minutes or less .
they &apos;re always concerned that they lose regalground .
because the images they make for them is real .
ohhhh , who , who !
and this video was actually launched in january .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s called collesters .
this approach is true for everything we do creatively .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what comes out of it .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done that .
and we actually show the whole process of what it works .
you &apos;ll see the whole thing in the film of state-line .
you know , we hear a lot of stuff about transparency .
lawyer : i am a lawyer toke .
i do . the first picture is a picture of my family .
and the film is going to be called &quot; the the the the the the the the the the the the
but what if you want to see the pinstrine peel ?
so , click , you &apos;re in this museum .
open the map , and jump you with a click .
in the inside of it , they want to be till the end of the gangs .
i love this guy ; its definition is unpaid .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
well , because they don &apos;t know it was different .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
the future is the online part of crime that most of crime will
mininotar is a certification .
but if you can get into a foreign child .
it was called automatically compelling rock .
a few years ago , i started to develop littarins
we also brought littingores to design schools .
a fish appeal , but it &apos;s a bird reserve .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
let &apos;s call it miguel . in fact , he &apos;s called miguel .
they did this by using the land .
this is a rare antar of ank .
now , he said the whole needs of phytoplankton .
ever from a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals ?
he said he didn &apos;t know . he &apos;ll follow .
&quot; 2.5 to one ? what feeds her ? &quot;
the program that i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
you like to test it for a talk in their rooms .
and interestingly , bono &apos;s also a ted prize .
we talk about the flight of information overflow .
i grew up with a voice deber science fiction .
this second fish , this is another kind of love story .
and i talked them , an expedition .
because he doesn &apos;t know what a neckpir should do .
he &apos;s really happy about that because he &apos;s deceived them .
you know , that &apos;s where it gets half of his desstop .
you feel that this is the real truth behind .
there &apos;s only the second best thing to do .
and here &apos;s two , maybe maybe three examples of presentation .
second , if it &apos;s right , it doesn &apos;t have a soul .
our imagination is a force that actually can create a reality .
this first one , this was more like a passionate monkey .
but , of course , it &apos;s the sum of all , very much , many ideas .
and in berlin , we had a mad engineering collective .
they have a renewable energy share today .
the conventional system looks like this all around the world .
and then we started to negotiate the insuherers .
so , when i was 15 , i decided to be a diver .
now , how do you start to talk the language of music ?
we &apos;ll just see a few times a few days .
and my talk today is mainly about these cognitions .
it evoves your urin . they almost never do .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our health system is mies .
don &apos;t tell me that these things have no consequences .
there was no santa trees . we did all of these .
and when i turn around , the fingers change its position .
that &apos;s scandel and we should be ashamed .
so the question is : can we do it ? i guess .
the first of those is falling , involving complexity .
what it did was it ruined the memories of the experience .
now , the memory self is a storyteller .
it has moments of life , one after one .
most of you are totally ignored by the remember-hitting self .
has one single one in the audience who sees people die ?
i take the breath true to the audience , consciously , or unconsciously .
so , research , it &apos;s just crazy , is just crazy .
so usually most people are starting to oript themselves about the task .
it &apos;s a question of whether you can get that to zero .
typically , you just start to touch up and some people don &apos;t .
because he doesn &apos;t have a lot of worry , you have a lot of worry .
so , many of you will say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
but as they talked to various people around the world , they &apos;ve talked about these possibilities .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons for everybody on the planet .
there &apos;s a gradugue one-on-step device there .
they invest a lot of your time in the assembly growing complex structures .
ceos is about average . but here it gets interesting .
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
because , frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
and this is the value of the experience , so simple exercise .
because the music is a language and a language is to communicate .
and of course , we all share the same adaptalities .
then the same thing happens as a good conversation is happening .
and i see a song like i could just give up a song ?
i started thinking , i should just cut the project .
i have to tell you , i think it was a big mistake .
i &apos;m probably not going to take any of them on this journey .
but the question i want to throw up is : why not ?
she said it was like a donnel crack from air .
and i guess many of you have done this too .
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious to what we need .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of this out there .
i believe that , and i feel like we should .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it smells too well .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean carbs .
valued america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
we take images of this mini-big bang in detectors .
if we push it up , we can go back a little .
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
and i think it &apos;s worth the world that looks like this .
this is a whole book , an example of non-imaging data .
maybe this is an artificial way to read an english book .
we can move from the poster to a physical view of that environment .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what modern progress enlists .
i think somehow that six is the sixsen dollar or something .
some people were disappointed that there was no poetry .
second , what economists call opperisiitity costs .
there &apos;s a magical crowd . i don &apos;t know what it is .
economists call this a pareto-improvement .
they increase the paralysis and bounce the happiness .
it turns out dna synthesization is very difficult .
so if i go to them side , that &apos;s your interest .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
when they walk , yes , every footprint , every footprint , is out there .
you can throw away where you &apos;re going and stand .
the evidence is that , incidentally , men aren &apos;t a pig .
we see that that phosphorus is really critical .
and the oil will replace us with different energy carders .
and it &apos;s especially the first time to ask what is right .
so , one thing that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
we could reduce this for 10 percent , but what does that do ?
so , for example , shame , the outcome of a car .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less disposable .
the things that only use , go into technical systems .
so , you know , they &apos;re helping them with this , asking them to be with the people .
there &apos;s a direct decnameship for this .
so again , in every store you can get things back .
so the question is , how do we deal with these wind ?
i &apos;m going to explain , &quot; to have what these sounds might have . &quot;
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be with you .
but i &apos;m not doing it before i &apos;m talking about it .
how many doors have the house that they live ?
and life lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
we &apos;ve been doing a vog age in this .
and others have another example of the ambiguies , the intelligent systems .
i apologize to believe that i need to be cut .
so the device you see here , which is not working .
if we don &apos;t actually give the phosphorus and leave it .
but also our perception is , how do you contemplate us .
the next phenomenon is that &apos;s also very interesting , of vision .
and six of a milliseconds , a very exciting phenomenon .
the less that i sort of think about it , the more intuitive it is .
i want to help you with a very particular aspect of curiosity .
and that &apos;s a bit hard to do , i think .
and these guys know something we &apos;ve lost out of the eyes .
turned the trash down on the side . went home .
but where would the next aed to help this patient ?
how did he get to looking for this particular way of looking for aid ?
if you do not do that , you can take away somebody .
the complaining of software takes a few years in the rule .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
it makes it impossible to say how the photo was actually implemented .
i knew she had come to goodbye .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
because that &apos;s where the real government is going .
we have to engage the machine &apos;s machine .
you have to imagine the tremendous challenges that you have to ask .
and sure enough , we can find fast food chains .
we have many cells that are not on their own .
and what we found is that , indeed , there was a context .
a typical walmart offers you 100,000 products .
precise time points are overcoming .
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logic side says .
do you know how many decisions you do in a typical day ?
do you know how many decisions you get in a typical week ?
it was a store that was called drawder &apos;s .
she could take place inside a time learning .
the words , as long as his friends , now , are turned back to his own .
they have to make 62 different decisions out of their car completely .
car colors , crew sigk , automobile , car -- i have 56 possibilities .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
cats look at these cats that look at this video .
today we don &apos;t just find some of what we do .
so , if you could make the lights back again .
here i am getting a bit of a thing . we look right here at the center .
they &apos;re new nanotechnologies on the way , nano-materials .
this is technology &apos;s supportive innovation that is there today .
i saw the jantage chashes and leave off .
this deputy ranger over to the elderly black .
bryan stevenson : well , there &apos;s all the possibilities .
then we can do this analogy for the future .
the cost of solar energy has fallen 50 percent by 50 percent .
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
wr : people who were helping us convict of innocent .
and the best part is possibly , what &apos;s expected to get us in the field of health .
we just have cross-out the 7-plus billion .
i want to end with a story that really was really excited .
we talk about a 300 , if a bat is beaten 300 .
i sent them home without talking to my intertmator .
more and more people came in , simply because they were angry .
they come to my view of my view , not even in museums .
so , light flies in a jar i found very exciting .
i say that because identity is very important .
so today , evolution can happen in the time range of microseconds .
so now we have been able to rewire the time-scale time .
because their lives depend on whether they did the job right .
because all these new technologies of today are feeding themselves from themselves .
i found that technology should do something , not killing it .
it &apos;s a really amazing invention when you think about it .
innovation , creativity , and development are not just from our heads .
i didn &apos;t learn that in my work as a lawyer .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special . &quot;
it was the fear of terror , who was her life .
i &apos;ve given some talks in germany about the death penalty .
we all have to believe things that we can &apos;t see .
so what i &apos;m just telling you is what is really amazing .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
now , where would you put your brain on that scale ?
so i &apos;m going to show you very much of what i &apos;ve brought .
and i &apos;m just going to show you my outfits for this week .
i have two pas in most of my activities .
and the general term we can use for the word &quot; sexual sex . &quot;
we produce androes , and we &apos;re talking about androgens .
if they didn &apos;t move more , you were buried .
i mean , what does someone get with so many outits ?
bonobos are our next living relatives .
the human genome project began in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
think of it as a kind of a flying point .
you see the person who wonders what happens inside .
i want to show you the latest project we &apos;re working on .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
this is the average size of a greenth ice ear .
but bonobos show the other side of the medal side of the ocean
so they &apos;re going to move around and make an eye installation like this .
i would like to argue that we &apos;re ready for our own epic game .
that &apos;s a fascinating adventure that is going on .
we know money is very important , targets are very important .
we found that in terms of happiness itself .
when we look at how feelings are about income .
that &apos;s going to affect policy , i think , coming in the years .
so , 10,000 hours is an incredibly interesting number , for two reasons .
but there was always a life-cycle of life in their presentations .
wouldn &apos;t you want to make it more changes in their genes ?
and i hope you &apos;ll design me with that play and play with me .
and if you manage , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
if you ask me today , i &apos;m not so sure .
again , what &apos;s the potential we want to do now ?
which one would you like if you could have one ?
he roes about 120 feet out of the water , or 40 meters .
so you can ask : how happy is this alive ?
are they ? they &apos;re a little nervous .
and what did i notice was i needed an expert .
so the driving force behind is the cy-power cypower .
now , i don &apos;t know how to be the receiver .
so , sir , can you help me ? i need help .
i really like your way of your way sergey brin .
so , you see , this film , we wanted the real version .
it looks pretty much like the fashioned of malolly .
i was the miracle of that day , which was not to die this day .
you are welcome to the fear . you will welcome the risk of your risk .
so you &apos;re just going to google project.work .
if the museum gave us the picture , they click on it .
so , for example , this picture , for example , has about 10 billion points , i think .
let &apos;s quickly jump quickly to the moma , again , again .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that wasn &apos;t just that way .
so , the previous example of it was to find details .
you go around the block and it &apos;s its open revision .
the revelation is that death is part of life .
so at the end of two weeks , we went back to tempt rooms .
now , there &apos;s all of those loads before the great revelation .
that keeps us in the position and leaves us .
so the options were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
it &apos;s going to be part of the show , which is pretty shy .
it &apos;s called eyewriter , and you can see the description .
i just wish i could see my kids growing up .
i was the only one who could be talking to the airport .
the pilot lasted the machine after the hudson river .
but i &apos;ve given myself my humanity also .
i didn &apos;t stumbled with my wife for two years .
almost like that , we were preparing our lives for it .
i went home from the emergency department on my way home .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is just going to become worse .
because , through marine reserves , we are basically removing the past .
you add a blue one , and you can make light .
and within a few years , lego , in every home , lego .
and that &apos;s what happened in the minotar case .
there are us in the cases of like the muinotar .
i was shocked , and i was shocked .
and the fashions of online criminals are very easy to understand .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
but they don &apos;t get the precedent losses .
these images are extraordinary because the transition goes very fast .
so nothing changed , and yet everything changed .
and yet , we still get to the galapagos .
but wait , this is my favorite project .
now , the living self alive lives alive .
we think about our future as we are careful .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
this is my skin . it &apos;s not a special effect of hollywood .
okay , let me squeeze a little blood for you .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
right now , you &apos;re in the present moment , but we have an incredible opportunity .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s mimic .
well , the two kinds of self are two terms of happiness .
we know something about what &apos;s true about happiness of happiness .
we &apos;re developing to collaborative thinking , heart creatures .
so , this is allowing you to match that through that growing by binds , trust and with each other .
my inspiration comes back from an event that goes back 2,500 years .
now , what does this have to do with placing that ?
we degrade a human being for our society .
and configuration and processing involves success and the combination of success .
so i give a 10,000-dollar prize for the winner to the winner .
now that &apos;s basic algebra , but let &apos;s take it through .
people here are having a lot of these wonderful of these very miracles .
now , i wondered how can i really get this over ?
it &apos;s the renewables , as they &apos;re often called .
you make the mistakes right now , and you pay for it much later .
a few . probably roughly as many as the most creative people here .
we hate to hate a lot of government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
the smallpox . the smallpox is killed by billions of people on this planet .
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , and it &apos;s very quick .
what about children &apos;s ? do we take that . why not ?
well , i think i understand the pharmaceutical industry .
we &apos;re going to sit with a game to get to the suffering of the real world .
every american of americans , about 20 tons , is in poor countries , less than one .
and the question was : how could you integrate technology , new technology with it ?
imagine every single one of people is being controlled .
and so , when we think about that , we have a very interesting situation .
i &apos;ve brought me seven other subsidied , and that &apos;s all .
that &apos;s what we call our lab perceptual design .
so if we do something about cities , it &apos;s a big deal .
now , that night , everybody went to celebrate it .
we find other odds about what your rights is .
i don &apos;t want to give a fish like a man exactly the same rights as a man .
that &apos;s what we want to use as a possible impulse for the flyfire .
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony .
and i said , &quot; how communicates it to you now ? &quot;
so we &apos;ve created a device that &apos;s completely freely freely freely freely .
we kill his bed to see it outside .
but a lot of people are trapped in a very strange position .
the system is as healthy ; it &apos;s completely self-autonomous .
he said , &quot; zoom , you need to go into the house .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
if you could just do one of those , it would be a completely different world .
our gut is a wonderful hostant environment for these bacteria .
this is all reality , and in the future , much more possible .
this is actually the actual tragedy of human and machine .
but nothing was invented that would let me go back to now .
ah , the majority . i like i like to see , as a doctor .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
now , if it doesn &apos;t seem hardly andly , there may be some appropriate time .
and that &apos;s called androgent receptor defect .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about individualism .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of individualism .
and i had to explain the journalists that there are no one .
and somehow we have to create changes that we have to stop on zero .
and the key indicator for this is the extinction of speech .
he said , &quot; we build existential , not intensive .
new investment in creating good jobs .
that &apos;s our youngest test at the bottom right .
this is a shot that made me in the ancient greece and the old rome .
but instead of getting into paniic , he just stopped .
this is one of the most painful correctories of a creative life .
the most powerful mounted mounted is the head of massey wur.
finally , a solution , big enough to solve our problems .
by the end of march , the lhc is retreirable .
it means we have a cultural impact between the scientific achievement .
most people know this from the software area .
it actually accepted two thousand words really , these networks .
and i thought that there was a very good code .
so this is just an application from many , you can do with it .
so , i think it &apos;s a very paralyty hack .
people said , &quot; well , have you been afraid , never succeed ?
and the interesting thing is , i &apos;m going to do a little trip .
should i be saying to this email ? should i write this letter ?
this struck me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
on the contrary , it &apos;s complex metaphysical worldview .
the modern industrial world , as we know it , is barely 300 years old .
it &apos;s our new home country , and it &apos;s called nunavlas .
it &apos;s an independent area . they &apos;re all they &apos;re trying to get mineral .
this is even live on the web . you can check it .
it goes beyond , much more , in the cultures of the pre-industrial times .
the machine was last year , last year , the machine was first coming .
i couldn &apos;t do it better . i didn &apos;t let myself down .
is it clear that the answer to the question is they are .
and if we can do that , we can start to start the chromosome ?
so , it looks like a basketball billff .
i &apos;ve been running an institution on the lhc last ted conference .
and these are just the biohacker , the individual people .
54 percent of the deaths were screaming through boiling .
but the key is , if i get right , it &apos;s just .
the same amount of counter-to-one presidential forces that you can do .
no more necessary to whistle or sing a log .
and i ask myself , how do i competent was this diagnosis ?
there was no tickle till there was an instrument .
one day , this mirrors says , yeah , there &apos;s a beautiful one .
man &apos;s supposed to be separated from the monkey or a common ancestor .
you learn to find the sounds on the notes on the instrument .
the x tricks of a piece of play is that equivalent .
there was the core competition of leopolidshah .
so here was finally a company trying to do it right .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
i was eaten him in a restaurant in southern spain .
this is a fish in the south western corner .
loud and leisecuce , f and b , etc .
i asked him , how he was asked to do such a fishing guy .
in the soil , over 60 percent of carbon is stored .
here it says that the more you forget , the better .
so we really have a piece of loss of loss for us to be so far away .
then , the general inposlings of the pre-industrial cultures .
and that &apos;s what i had last year .
so i was busy doing what was of course or intuitive .
that &apos;s the time that most of the perceptions we have .
and they were making this with the legue national maps .
the components will become more and more to the friend that you live with .
now , even if they were going to shoot , they would have emissions .
so we don &apos;t have to control people , make a little bad .
that is , it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
and i &apos;m not so sure you really stay inside .
how did his life conditions , like the society and politics ?
think , it &apos;s free , none of us deserves to do it .
she said , &quot; that will be very , very tired . &quot;
in many areas , people had to fear of lynnmobs .
so the dramatic high numbers are coming in the prison prison .
how can a judge turn someone into something that he doesn &apos;t mean ?
i believe that too many places that are the opposite of poverty .
if someone lies in , it &apos;s not just a liar .
because ultimately our humanity is dependent upon all human being .
and so i think the ted community should be obert .
it &apos;s about creating kalp goods .
it was always so inspiring , so that &apos;s the way that he was flying .
what about a sentence of new new women voting .
but somehow we can get it to us from this problem .
the death penalty in america is defined by delrace .
in my opinion , mass inheritings have altered our world .
i looked at her and smiled , but she looked very serious .
in the short time there , i realized , ted has an identity .
a child in india says , &quot; now i have a monkey . &quot;
i love this one : &quot; watson forces human adversary . &quot;
so , find programs that are most numbling to do nuts .
he took the king of siam to dinner .
some of my favores have been found in the last five years .
&quot; now she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in that particular note .
and the best part is they connect with magnees together .
basically , the concrete structure was the construction block of our time .
somebody was getting broken and had the system froffed .
a long time ago there was gry whales -- 500 years ago .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re holding , but i can do it .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely unbelievable .
and what &apos;s underneath is what we call bureaucracy .
i looked into the guts , and it was a little bit pink .
how about pests we can &apos;t even predict ?
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
and when i listened to her , she made me sound .
and i was good , i was just piled with cum laude .
and that &apos;s the message i took in medical school .
that means that the player is searching to seep .
and that game was playing by university professors and so on .
this piece of 50 technology was really going to have the most magical thing for me .
i &apos;m sad that we never heard each other as a grown-woman .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this strange landway .
if you look at the people you &apos;re dealing with ...
why is it important to start refining ? what does this red point ?
i like some things that are quebful . i like some weird things .
what is the idea of thinking about themselves and feelings about themselves ?
if they could do it for those , they would help me help me .
this is my brand in my little , crubbling industry .
so maybe you &apos;d just put a little bit of this in front of the interview . &quot;
that actually includes a two-and-a-half pounds of a two weeks .
and just so disappeared all these companies , one after another .
finally , at the pre-proposed , we should welcome fear .
these people are going to be related to the movie for everness forever .
but , of course , it &apos;s a very good medim opportunity .
and when the threat are threaten , really bad things can happen .
of course , this cannot be done by a human machine leader .
and guess what we found in the attacks of the code ?
this is an angelout from this attack of attacks .
an eight-end , marked marke . what &apos;s your brand ?
and that urgency , this goal really changed my life .
well , then the film has acquired a very big place .
the biggest fear was that they had them from pisting , rape and death .
because the categories tell me how to travel them apart .
and she &apos;s been so spread , obviously , organic , of course .
for example , the fish was taken on one of the locals .
the first rule is that combined images should be built .
pictures like this : a construction station , a much more eruption .
three months later , i was around and the adventure kept going .
the possibility that would not have been allowed were explicitly encouraged .
i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .
but at youtube , more than 48 hours of video , they uploaded a minute .
i don &apos;t know why it did it , but i learned something about it .
we can deal with more categories than with more choices .
my friends from honduras asked me to say , thank you ted .
in fact , this air-square kilometers of the air has a meter of square miles .
so it turns out it &apos;s very hard to get all this extensively .
so i went back ahead and i was doing this just a few years ago .
but at the same time , we need a good share of intuition to actually do the experiments .
we have litted in children , and we see them playing with it .
microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the uranity is consumed in a bit of time , a bit like a candle .
and we were to a right family class class for a very , very family .
nasa has a single favorite sentence : &quot; fail is not an alternative . &quot;
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation , with electricity in the rich world .
co2 warms the planet and equation is actually quite clear .
and the answer is , until we get close zero , the temperature will rise up .
and so i want to show you what different i &apos;m going to show you .
so we can jump now and look at all the ted winner winner winner .
so if we go back from there , how should the 2020 praypoint look like ?
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can fulfill it .
and it &apos;s sitting there and burning 60 for 60 years and then it &apos;s done .
a nuclear reactor , even a solution to the trash .
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptic is the skeptic in very different camps .
and from here , i can go into the site and record it again .
they produced the highest construction in the slithiest time .
i said , &quot; miguel , don &apos;t drop your fish ? &quot;
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fish to the birds .
there &apos;s already what &apos;s enormous about the global speed of life .
we have three gigawatts photovoltaics in germany .
i was playing the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s wilderine concertium .
and this feed of 2.5 to one , he said .
and so 1982 has been a spanish company in 1982 .
i really believe that , and no , that &apos;s not a joke .
it &apos;s just to see if you go back and think about it .
it &apos;s the last defense before something happens to the body .
because if the water hits , it dives in the atlantic .
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
and the other research is actually looking at men .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
and that &apos;s a transition that i think you can think of .
it &apos;s a natural joke from asia , where the case is of japan .
they create an epic source of knowledge about warcraft .
it &apos;s people who think that they can change the world as being individuals .
well , these are three weeks , and they &apos;re at the very far one and a half .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design computer games .
this is a portrait of photographer phil toledano .
we think we &apos;re in reality not as good as play .
and that &apos;s what i want to study as a graduate student .
from the inhablary himself , len has clearly been a bad time .
and she was much more likely for a than b in memories .
there were sheep beds in front of these amazing game controllers .
and thank god i didn &apos;t use synonymous at the time .
and i tend to do that wietalities as my shadow .
are we in a kind of evolutionary equilibrium form in a spectarian ?
i wanted us to live a long and healthy life .
and the end of these are very , very important , and in this case dominated the end .
because , in fact , we have to prove , well , it &apos;s the soul .
we love to shin ourselves in headaches . we love that .
and all i can say is , why do we fight this ?
starved studies were done to see if that was true .
and they can do this because they &apos;re not connecting to connect cause and correlation .
he was liberated from one of the worst things of humanity .
i don &apos;t need to say that , but vaccines are unleashes .
why ? because we have no child &apos;s case , and guess what ?
we type , we give one , we &apos;re going to eat , that &apos;s okay .
and you &apos;re asked to ask , &quot; who of them have suffered more ? &quot;
it &apos;s a deception to something that is more important , because someone &apos;s perceiving it .
the knife you can study , my hand , you can study .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue ball .
i would clean my arm out and show you that there are no wobts .
not only do we tell stories about us , not only when we do it , tell stories .
you can see it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
all cultures have involved and involved in the dance with new living possibilities .
because a good engineer has either built or nuclear cars , or nuclear power plants .
i wrote four words , and i would like to give you a quick story .
crucially , the information training is since the time of information .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
you put it in a ton and it tends to put it up .
and then we &apos;ve been working with a codes of hebal .
and then the company then gets open open and &quot; open space and &quot; citizen science . &quot;
and that &apos;s the core issue from the biohacker .
and proposal was to build a lot more carbs .
it &apos;s okay . the question is , how is it going to do ?
that means you navigently navigate and about rhythm .
what the &quot; the super affam of course is extremely opposite , and it &apos;s a computer game .
now , not anymore in local level , it &apos;s on global scale .
and see how we process information , how do we take information like that ?
and the most important thing is to look at the floor as the first thing .
so the alliance for climate policy has established two camcampaigns to life .
right , we can get that way , and we can get nutrients in this way .
well , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we put it ?
to put it in my context , i was born in 1946 .
but what if the picture you &apos;re connected to all your pictures ?
official belief is from all western industrialized societies .
they rented your phone . they didn &apos;t bought it .
it &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
why ? i wrote a whole book to explain what i am trying to do .
because it &apos;s unkindness to go and take out nutrients .
is there continue to be for your contribution , whatever it is .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all sorts of different ways .
writing books is my profession , but of course , it &apos;s more than that .
the answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is : yeah .
if your work flew -- not quite your fault , right ?
he was running all the track and did something completely new .
you can only have a nuclear missions if you &apos;re not there .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see them here .
and he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire .
i want to tell you what we found in my institute .
a piece of work you never look at has no power .
and that was the first beginning of a new musical expression .
and as i say , the word justice tells me , that unpleasant feeling .
and then scared rocks so he can give them the view .
from that time , a company that &apos;s talking about .
whether music is shaping you or too sweet .
listen consciously , and say , &quot; you know , it &apos;s like you or not . &quot;
the soul is kind of a kind of intellectual , it says , &quot; roughly badniz . &quot;
now , this is a three-sentence , which gives us a logic .
because it just lies that you can just use this logic just wrong .
the first sentence is claim , there are no soul .
and if i &apos;m right , the chanzi is a man .
why am i now practicing my audience that it &apos;s also too possible to hear ?
if i &apos;m right , the chanzi is not a man .
interpreting are translation of the word in clinical music .
the notes that the notes have got the function of a script .
because the frathers may best return the phosphorus back .
there &apos;s a bunch of opec a bunch of orphar .
if you throw away the wrong things , you have a waste problem .
but if i ask you , how are you going to do with your wife ?
and now , there are a lot of people working there and you can engage yourself .
that &apos;s high-tech agriculture , of course , but the plants are tailing themselves .
but don &apos;t tell me , don &apos;t i understand the classical music .
you collect information about the piece in the sekal literature .
now , keep twimerats , right in front of the composer .
often , music is the case that you &apos;re just learning the notes .
you can basically learn to read until you just talk a single word .
so the hammerheads in the piano are the sequel of my fingers .
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean the longest living .
she said , &quot; a word ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
in 1972 , 300,000 people were 300,000 people in their neighborhoods .
it &apos;s pulling images and text together , and animation , sounds and touch .
fantybooks have always had maps , but these cards were static .
my grandmother was at the end of the room , and starling me up .
and so , i want to look at this in the time-scale of the earth .
of course my grandmother would tell you all of their grandcalews , they &apos;re something special .
i &apos;m going to start showing you one , just one , boring slide .
the united states today has the highest incarceration rate in the world .
she said , &quot; what are you going to do if you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i finally got down from my car , and i went to the court .
my story starts right here in rajasthan about two years ago .
well , in fact , the number of violence has not changed very much .
another more bright thing , i &apos;m going to draw on the paper .
and there they developed great apps with urban workers .
but she does what no other government does .
this is my wlan-wal . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
maybe you &apos;re familiar with the familiar , i &apos;ve talked about 4,000 persons on twitter .
and over 10,000 aeds were already captured in the netherlands .
the basis of a lot of this process is to grow up with explicit .
you &apos;re going to shoot it up when it was snail .
and these apps are using our hands to improve our communities .
we now know , now , nine cities , the planning to use this app .
and not even like a tech company , but rather like the internet itself .
it &apos;s not politically active , so office recruit .
56 percent of all rapes are not going to court .
so it &apos;s more about to capture an idea than actually a moment .
bryan , here &apos;s a really string of pigs here .
the reason for this is that the government was able to retrap , where a text came from .
it shows us precyptented what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
this shows the tremendous role that can play an ocean protected area .
because it pocks a little bit of wavesh that &apos;s lost in a certain way .
they also had a sheet of unpreceding of this typewriter machine .
you might think that it was finning , but that &apos;s not true .
and this is one of the three main sources of that today .
&quot; do you remember the patient of the camel with the camel ? &quot;
those are the questions we have to turn to the next 50 years .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out .
but there is a key difference : the transistor is just for experts .
and then you want to get the most powerful overremains .
so , photographs where you have to think a short moment to start figuring out the trick .
what you need is an environment that you can use to do .
by 2020 , we will predict two billion internet users .
do you know how to call a three-mile in the major league of league ?
today we can have a dozens of companies that did this .
we live on a planet that &apos;s 70 percent with water .
and there &apos;s new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
this is the result of faster computers building the faster computers .
and i think it begins with a medical person and i am .
and yet , when he went out of the door , he showed his races .
&quot; do you remember the patient that they introduced home ? &quot;
you say that you never forget the names of the die .
if you make it done , you never make the mistakes again .
but this is actually completely lined out of some of the different locations .
if we look at predictions , these kinds of changes are going to be increasingly possible .
and so , this can actually be paralyzed by their eyes , or draw it with their eyes .
and i always tell people that i can &apos;t come to come and come from a scientist .
and it &apos;s just like , show you a different side of his personality .
so we decided to do tony -- tempt , and then supported his piece .
did anybody see the movie &quot; butterfly and pailspace ? &quot;
it &apos;s something that we work for for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s played up the same .
but that &apos;s happening a lot of unbeing transports and more complicated things .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i want to tell you about .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to friends , to people .
they knew any bits and bydas that they had to attack .
it has all digitized , knowledge , and power is accessible by the internet .
and neither the machine leaders , nor the security leaders , will notice .
it &apos;s simultaneously real-time real-d scan and a movement .
we actually tend to be inconvenient in all sorts of ways .
so how are we going to ask the question of nature &apos;s properties ?
bruno guissani : mark , mark , come back .
to adapt to an inconvenient world , we need to play .
under a hat , i &apos;m concerned about the history of anatomy .
so that &apos;s the whole concept , the whole film , from the beginning to end .
we &apos;ve been in two creatures , both in the 1979 .
it was as italy called football championship .
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for day .
but it wasn &apos;t until i turned 30 , i really understood what that means .
we should be able to pine everything that we want .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
there are 68 million people sitting in the world &apos;s wheelchair .
so all of these green areas , these are the most targeted environments .
now there are 10,000 parodians from &quot; friday &quot; on youtube .
the scaffolds from the ladaver came from the rest of the world .
okay . so each one &apos;s ready to engage gary &apos;s charge .
one is called jazz , and the other is called &quot; swing . &quot;
every single one of you could be famous about the internet to the next saturday .
this business , it was almost like a fun savings .
and now we all feel as self-owner as our poppos .
all the parties , all of the fractions of society , this is what supported this .
before i leave the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
now i &apos;d like to have my own children , and i &apos;m still thinking about the boat .
and also , the mother &apos;s mother is here today in the fourth .
people are still worrying when i say , &quot; limiting . &quot;
because that &apos;s a picture of course , of course , a picture of it .
how good do you think you &apos;re in the choices ?
how do we develop these intuition ? well , we love playing with things .
so quantum mechanics says that unmobile objects can only feel .
tell me about what &quot; why &quot; phase -- what does it get them ?
today , more than ever , it gets a little bit honesty .
that &apos;s the anders in the national century .
i like a lot of black colors , a lot of gray bees and stuff like that .
so i did this thing in a similar way that you make a computer chip .
so i sat down , and you &apos;ve played a tedtalk .
don &apos;t move the way the homes of cities are coming from .
he was asked to be an octo , his dignity .
meanwhile , i went to a talk at tedglobal .
and beyond the simple play , littlive actually is quite powerful .
right now , in this world , we think that data is a flight .
and , instead of moving into information , we can get knowledge from that .
this is the one that refuses to two billion years of labor .
and if we can do this for our raw data , why can &apos;t you be in content for content ?
so i can zoom in in a given time trading .
here &apos;s the state that i was announced to this .
and i can kind of get everything i &apos;ve seen today , again .
he said , &quot; no . they do this because the food is better . &quot;
it took about 90 percent of the birds , which are many birds , what are the place of a lot of them .
so , were movies of the road , images and stories , and that was the fit together .
they don &apos;t exist in sunlight in the sun , as we do .
but i didn &apos;t understand much of leadership before i got this expedition .
because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what am i doing here ?
and it &apos;s written at nine billion . that &apos;s moving to nine billion .
we are not a realistic , we &apos;re enjoying . we &apos;re lover .
in your notion , time and probability of life really , in your imagination , have really to live your life ?
we have to build our griir dials on the net .
and it &apos;s going to give a whole bunch of conflicts and argues .
and the power of a hundred nuts of power , because it &apos;s very quick all the time .
we were only five people at the time rebuilding the society .
we can also accelerate two hundred watts of rock volvoltaics on the web .
if you pull down that somewhere , it &apos;s a time for me to go across it .
and we can turn two milliseconds of this big battery out of it .
and with each occasion , the children actually work directly what &apos;s worked and what doesn &apos;t .
up to the 1980s , the farm was in argentina .
and then he added on , &quot; we are essentially a world .
so the next day , i called the session , i &apos;m just not going to go .
&quot; don &apos;t , &quot; i said , &quot; what for example are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
a dimate journalist had spoken from this fish a long time .
who can make a fish so well tasty after it got dimming ?
i &apos;ve done daily times , geothermal , merging and biofuels .
that &apos;s what it got to do with us going back to the 10th century .
and he said , &quot; well , you may not remember me .
and the very crucial thing about this study was that the teachers were not discompassed .
well , they would know about its size , but there &apos;s a lot of insecurity .
some of you might be thinking , &quot; this is a lot of time for games . &quot;
why is it that games can &apos;t be done to think that you couldn &apos;t just do anything ?
and players are always ready to work hard when they get the right job .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; superstruct &quot; on the institute for the future .
or , &quot; how did your trip go to albania ? &quot; or something .
and people in the back says , &quot; okay , i didn &apos;t see this right . &quot;
and one night , there &apos;s a pap on his hotel door .
he &apos;s a beautiful condust showgirl in front of him .
she looks at him and he says , &quot; i &apos;m a supersex . &quot;
we call these robots exoskeletskeletons at berkeley .
but unfortunately , bonobos are the least known among the primates .
we actually don &apos;t choose between the experience of the experience , and we choose between memories of the experience .
here &apos;s what they need , but also to lift the willingness .
he just developed a rotaral vaccine just with some other people .
she would not vaccinate her kid against child &apos;s disease . no way .
so is it really interesting that high power sentences have a strong effect ?
that number goes up very fast , and it goes very fast , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
and soon i wrote an article about everennish food .
these were the careful people , geeduguted people , incrementant people .
careless studies should be done ; that &apos;s a serious issue .
it &apos;s incredible . you look around and you see this team is going to win . &quot;
now we &apos;re actually in the same way that we had in the field of measuring the measurement trick .
that &apos;s okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark uruts .
it &apos;s not about swing genes . it &apos;s not chemicals .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , and so that was an amazing thing to me .
i &apos;ll take something which obviously is a deception , and we &apos;re going to look real .
you can see it in a second , but you can see , if you like .
if you build more wind power to each other , the system starts to fail .
but the wazine i killed not only the seats with the speans .
and now our desperate consciousness senses away from it , and you can do something .
it turns out he was just pile the criminals .
each has four different variations ; you can select , which you want to use .
this is not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel !
but even i have this thing up in my mouth , sometimes .
but if you tell them , most of the water is going to fall out of drinking water .
oil is a problem , and coal is the equivalent of the biggest problem .
valuing america with 100 percent clean electricity , within the next 10 years .
an extraordinary statement that you can make about your life .
with your chemical block , john -- how are you doing this ?
it &apos;s effects that you can change live , like hall and filter .
but always the one of the things that &apos;s the approach is that it &apos;s just going to be accessible and accessible .
and that hasn &apos;t really worked , but we &apos;ve learned a lot more .
and then i took a savany pencil and i plug it up .
and what &apos;s interesting is that they are in southern asia .
in fact , he can feel sometimes parananant .
why don &apos;t we sing to get from the top of a to b ?
we all know what &apos;s good about , so i &apos;ll get a little bit about what &apos;s wrong with it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects in people .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything about that ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
this meant that , while the chinese invasion was exposed to the chinese invasion .
superglutated up on the top of the earth &apos;s orbit .
but the spatial order of the images is actually in fact .
this is actually a poster of notre dame , which was really tested .
what does it mean to our thinking and our consciousness ?
and i was frightened of a lot more stuff that nobody had ever antiasted .
clinical depression , exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
so , does chemistry do these really large molecules , what have never been done before ?
you see in the upper field that his chromoor just falls apart .
and i talked back to get to just tell you what the machine works .
did you worry that you &apos;re going to charge the demation of a lead ?
and part of these hackerspaces , these places are being put together .
but at the same time , they had a clear understanding of forest , which was astonishing .
the continual paper now is not promoting .
you don &apos;t need to make it more than a little borer .
the point of letters you can see when you can do the language .
i &apos;ll say to my own words , which could be written between that frast .
all of this affects me and all this affects my experience with composition .
he asked me what the introduction of these ballacy for me was .
our vocal truchard to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
we tell people , oh yeah , you have no environmental consciousness in the south .
a woman in germany was eating about six comma three kilograms of her lifetime .
so they &apos;re able to get incessable what they just thought of in the mind .
i say , well , what do you need in a big car ?
you can also try this , in words like rakes or gains , or similar .
it &apos;s very easy to figure out that it has a whole different sense of mind .
so a little bub that &apos;s interested in this guy is not about the fire .
because those are just the characters that you learned to paint .
it &apos;s something that is not about stop , physical , physical nature .
traditionally , we think in environmental debate , we &apos;re too many on the world .
you can only be a car tracking , if you don &apos;t exist , right ?
and these two worlds are all sitting together , new and old thinking .
many use the word , but don &apos;t really know what it means .
and then it goes back to the back , and it &apos;s actually just seen .
and this is the projection of vision , back backing , seeing .
because everybody talks about energy , but nobody is talking about the phosphorus problem .
then the next generation we actually got to live today .
that means we don &apos;t have to control people , make a little bad .
there are still six hits of the amazonorization alone in the amazon .
you &apos;ve heard about the overpopulation of trees , you know ?
that means that all of our intelligence means we want to be dunosauas as trees .
we &apos;re in brazil , we &apos;re doing the nutrients .
we do that in china , for example , where we take the waste from this .
bonobos -- how humans -- love playing their lives .
but in a way , we think of a way that &apos;s integrated in our own lives .
we &apos;re doing that , so we &apos;re rational for it to estimate so much .
but you can also think about it differently , depending on how we see our identity .
but the africanger in this country was a time of terror .
and so , we really understand what our actions in the historic context have .
she was something that was going on , you &apos;d always be in love with you .
their parents were born in virginia in the 1840s .
they come from ideas that are driven by the persuasion in our heart .
now , vaclav hazz , the great chief politician once said .
that we are all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to . don &apos;t just make sure . just do it . &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started arguing .
and every being that is using the exact same letters and the same code .
so this allows us to work now as a unified organism .
and we will not improve government until we improve the national citizenship .
this is a slide i &apos;ve chosen random from my point .
in other words , each step here is a potential in the performance scale .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what are you doing in the court ? &quot;
and we &apos;re back to them in a contemporary story of children .
i don &apos;t know what each of the individual transistors do .
i &apos;m just going to khoya , which is an interactive ipad app .
this map grows and glows , and serves as an orientation on the rest of the book .
sometimes these ideas prefer to our thinking , in a very important way .
and he didn &apos;t really have an idea . it starts with the ascler .
of course , many people will recognize that it was really different .
in this record , it was a holder called &quot; finfisman . &quot;
i went there because i grew up in europe and wanted to work in africa .
they were not eaten , they were threening because they were dead .
over time , little fishing left , and we think that &apos;s the activity of activity .
how can i teach you my errors so that they don &apos;t have the same meeting ?
he had a potential potentially life-dangerous disease called epiglottitis .
they had this program sold for 280,000 euros to the egyptian government .
they &apos;re wired , light , sound , and sensor .
lights , sound , solar elements , motors -- everything should be available .
in this state , about 24,000 canadians are in immensely mislinable mishes .
but what they really do is show what is possible with technology .
it &apos;s a lot better this year . it &apos;s on the rising branch .
and it worked for a while , until i met women .
it &apos;s not a wonder that everybody thinks it &apos;s always worse .
the king of siam got aluminum beer .
it &apos;s not about the kschness , the problem is accessibility .
social decline . more prineed , 60-dead .
it turned out he had a pagtococon infection .
and after two , three days ago , they realized they never saw awaesight .
and it wasn &apos;t because of my upper book , very bored-line .
why did i ask the &quot; doctor &quot; ? why did i end them home ?
a citizen helped another citizen , but the government played here a central role .
so , sex is distributed , both at bonobos and humans are spread .
he &apos;s called &quot; thylacots &quot; to the official database .
this centrifuge in iran are given up in seven so-called places .
and this gave us great insight for what we were looking at here .
and you know , this part of life needs everything to the rest of life .
the pilot had had the machine going and we weren &apos;t getting that far away .
they probably knew the shoe size of the machine administration .
i was like , &quot; very archaic , how can that be ? &quot;
temped with one of the leading graffiti artists of the 80s .
we need to set up the consequences , and we &apos;re going to start preparing ourselves better .
there &apos;s only one , and those are the united states -- fortunately , luckily .
so despite that warning , i knew that anybody would buy the passion right .
so we &apos;re out to figure out how to do it better , faster and more .
now i can answer all your questions and give you a horrible array .
if all the answers is , i feel like i won .
well , our environment , for the very first time , is starting to answer us .
and they really kind of put a really wonderful way of preparing the future civil movement .
now in practice , people are not tested on their chromos .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
and so i found a company called olson zest in pittsburg .
and we got a paper building building the expo .
half-time , people make a quick call , go to the toilet .
and the plastic bottle that we still throw away every day is still there .
it causes something like a waterfight with a model of water .
our politicians say it says our president says , &quot; even our ceos , &quot; we even tell our ceos .
democracy grew up , but at the same time , science grew up .
because you &apos;re doing this when you &apos;re called yosemite mountain &apos;s head .
it seems like the &quot; double rainbow &quot; appears to be from nothing .
this is a highly powerful category .
go from the little choice to the many , then you &apos;ll stay on .
three things : tastemaker , part-setric communities and unexpected .
so if you &apos;re basically thinking about it , it &apos;s where we are today .
there &apos;s already two cities built in china , and the third is prepared .
if you want to know that , these other tiaks are also fridays .
nyan geris is animation and music in endstreps .
what roscrited books now can be able to write in that way ?
every single harvard &apos;s staff is automatically part of a life-lived fund .
and they can do that through these sorts of actions , but also through crowdsourcing .
he was still a little kid , and not very good at it , and he constantly begun .
and here &apos;s a really big closement of that little piece of metal .
big data is turning into great opportunities for organizations around the world .

now , when i use the term &quot; miracle , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
there are some innovations in zero-scale ; modular , liquid .
they talk about it , they think about how it looks , they ranel around .

not fear , not feasifying , child paralysis , muff , disappeared .
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be boss panisse , but it would be nice .
but this isn &apos;t actually about , actually , and then i open my hand .

these are real patients who are sending a painful procedure .
so i can step back and jump right into a specific section .
now , they couldn &apos;t act that the valid did not work .
it was evolved over the evolution to look unconcredently . &quot;
now i want to do this idea a little bit more about what &apos;s a little crazy .

when you take things wrong , they &apos;re still more effective than a tablelete .
and i might want to introduce my inem to me that i &apos;m going to try and think of you .
but it &apos;s also about the aging population whose numbers multiplied .
this is the world of wild bonobos in the forgo forest of congo .
we can make wide-acder a new meaning that goes beyond severe times .
wide-acits are for a change that we &apos;re not using yet .

so again , change and customization are the greatest capacity in human beings .
actually , you should have shown for the first time to prove whether there &apos;s something like being being like being like being
oh , you know that . ok . private . so we here .
this is me , as i am in life , i &apos;m bad face .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply to , one unit self .
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process .
if you ask the luck of the memory to ask yourself , it &apos;s a completely different thing .
in the spirit of the other selves , the memory self , the remember-man , they get another story

now , repeently , the memory repeatedly makes more than remembering stories .
they were playing for 18 years , we &apos;d play for 16 years , we &apos;d play for the 16 years .
so , you know his theory of success , the theory of success of that 10,000 hours .

not the work itself . it was so much darkness as the eh .
these organisms can be really dried , they can even live in vacuum .
so 12 to 24 hours later , it &apos;s all fine together as it was .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it does .
the united states is one of the two largest polluts , along with china .
this is in our entire country of two largest waste of decundant america .
so let &apos;s do a tour of this modern , clean coal-factory factory .
america is a crisis , in crisis , the national security , the climate crisis .
this is not electron microscopes , it &apos;s a regulary microscopic .
and now i &apos;m going to connect the filters with the bass , for something more expression .
so , you know , i never believed that i would never work at the end of this microsoft .
i want to start with what i call &quot; official dogma . &quot;
but you ask the indians they say , &quot; the plant talks to us . &quot;
this is bleak house of dickens . every column is a chapter .
we also did something about the corner of this particular output of the guardian .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by semisragon .
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;ve been time to show you others .
so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to sort closer to the matter , so that &apos;s what we do
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , phrases , thoughts .
should i marry ? am i only trying to have children , or do i just do it ? &quot;

wonderful beach . great day . you have it all for yourself .
when they came to 100 species , it &apos;s daring , one of them would have to be perfect .
a chromosome is just a piece of inherted chemical material .
it &apos;s a story with obvious and he &apos;s going to decide how it &apos;s evolving .
it will not be done in the reality of reality , it &apos;s the resolution of reality .
if that &apos;s due to failure , the students will get the next hard piece .

you &apos;re studying the works that he used before and after .
you put a new idea in it , and you &apos;ll answer that .
every time it &apos;s a exciting thing , because it &apos;s a new thing , and i &apos;m reading something new .
there &apos;s the depolet on the depous , but also in the landscape , right ?
because they still changed the chairman of the ground twice .

she may love it because he has a tendency to justify .
it &apos;s impossible to present things in a society that &apos;s supposed to work .
so the baby is carbon positive for life , from the very beginning .
here &apos;s this logic in this , yes , in this deception .
and then it was caused by the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
because steve jobs said that you must have a mission to slow for it .
a project i started recently was to build a gene gun .
and you have to do it too and understand it and understand it .
where the language was subordinated by subordinated ranges .
you can explain that as well , there &apos;s more that there &apos;s more stuff .
of course , this virtual world lives into the walls of our cities , and it &apos;s clear .
and what are our values , and what are our target , our foundation ?
that means you can see the internet in the internet , as you can pull out the nutrients .
stealing law from the continuity and so on .
so we have our eyes right now , and you think , we see , at the beginning , we see the very
and i have a interface at a time , which is a lot of intuitive and a lot of natural power .
that means we &apos;re not too many ; we &apos;re stupid , right ?
and we &apos;ve been to dumb in our western world , and we &apos;ve been to dumb our nutrients .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should be doing the anatomy .
they use their hands to write applications that improve government &apos;s work .
but in &quot; habforms &quot; is all public forms so that everybody can see it .
so if i look at this program , i can &apos;t tell how they work .
and then finally , i get programs that are perfectly iteming .
and it &apos;s partly making it partly with methods that we don &apos;t even understand .
and those next steps , as electronics , seem to be very few tens of tens of tests .
that &apos;s why for example , the ensurance to antibiotics is growing .
and what they did -- that made these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
these little oil spills in the sense that they were the most primitive cell form .
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
this is a generation that grew up with their voice for granted .
what was , your sister had , and i &apos;d go , drink a beer .
so he did what any good developer was going to do , he wrote an app .
and they realized that the city is never crashed this hydrant .
they were there in february , and it has gotten a lot of smashed in february .
instead of shipping into the third world , we &apos;re going to send them into rathets .

no one knew where the nearest life-saving aed was going to find .
she was also the origin of many arguments in our family .
but if i could give this to me , i would do it safely , i would do it .

different speakers : drug war , mass destruction .
the idea behind lilitharal is that it is a growing library .
littlive are electronic modules that have a specific function .
this is wladimir tsastan from tarel in estonia .

basically the sea &apos;s basis came off deck and then thrown back .
up to the 1980s , it was fished in a great style .
the rest of the day , the night i had the epinight feeling of this mliche .

these people represent multiple trillions of dollars going into the global economy .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? how about you ? &quot;
and yet , 46 percent of all the leameros did not have a brick .
i teach these kids who were convicted too hard .
if someone takes something that doesn &apos;t hear it , it &apos;s not just a pib .
we need to find a tendency to ask these challenges : this is the problems , the suffering .
it would be foreseen of us , awareness and committed people .
i talk about race and asking whether we have the right to kill .
and they believed that this was the subjects that we needed to care about .
it &apos;s not about what realistic is , but what we think is in the realistic .
he said , &quot; tell me what is female about feminism . &quot;
if there is a letter in our family , it &apos;s going to be running through the women .
imagine a big explosion of explosion as you go up on a thousand feet .
and someone who has a kind of an artist potential , deserves as much more .
but is it a difficult thing about film or difficult thing , and is it a really difficult thing to do with me ?
and in fact , this false data of stuxnet has been recorded before .
and we just got the only s-end and we just had to rebrand ourselves .
so we had a theories about these goals that we could see or disagree .
the idea behind the elxnet computer worm is pretty simple to be .
and more than anything , are you the best parents that you can only be ?

she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .

as an ice berg melts , i &apos;m taking a temporary atmosphere .
imagine that every one of anyone can give a little donation for an image .
you see the phanologum in the middle , the tiquid tidge .
and that &apos;s what is radically changed interaction that we have in our environment .
now all of these objects , our environment , are starting to talk to us .
they would call them in engineering teams , a real-time control system .
but when it comes to that , it &apos;s supposed to be implemented .
if you think you &apos;re looking into something good , it &apos;s almost safe .
what about the inter-? what about the intericingststypes ?
we decided to do an experiment , and we chose marmeles for our experiment .
a million people just escape latin america every year and migrated into the united states .

let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : the kon of a car .
well before we started talking today , i had a conversation with gary .

we don &apos;t choose to decide , even though it comes to our own best interests .
i was looking through the shosard of the shozzine and i saw it on the other side .
just for about 12 percent of their choices needed it or more of their time .
and i think some companies will only focus on a strength , rather than either .
and a new city is also moving new opportunities for leaders .
but it didn &apos;t take them to describe the big things around us .
it &apos;s not as if they &apos;re both exclusively or anything .
i went close , and i slowly noticed that these kids actually punish something .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what &apos;s the point to 10 billion points ? &quot;
i think my personal view is very simply with this slide and her access .
i think if you keep people away from that , you get them closer to failure .
and here we see filch , paper and water bottles like this ...
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the paper , i kept on .
we talk about ironically , with little leadership , about &quot; progress . &quot;
you might ask : why would someone actually invest on a marshmallow challenge ?
it &apos;s a blog where you see how you &apos;re building marshmallow .
big machine , cool , ted machine , and that &apos;s a time machine .
but it &apos;s not about people like us , because this is a greater thing than that .
they don &apos;t have a right to have their own facts . &apos; tasigation , they don &apos;t .
his new masy is now : &quot; why does research do research anymore ? &quot;
and because you burn these 99 percent , it &apos;s a lot better than that , that &apos;s a lot better .

i know you &apos;ve done it because half the americans do this day .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge food problem , but that &apos;s not science .
constructive , this kind of collaboration as an iterative preoccupiation .
it &apos;s the limited resource we use while we are on the world .
and i &apos;ll fly with a little robotic stuff through the halls of the ship .
i actually do it , but my consciousness is actually only in the vehicle .
and i hold my love on the ocean with the same intensity as the eh and the way .
so we went in terminator 2 , &quot; my next movie , even further .
and we did that , and we got a competitive advantage to us .
but i really wanted to dive into the real wingpone of titants .
this is a very important thing . it &apos;s a good refueler for marketing . &quot;
if you &apos;re not a player , you may get some of the nuances in this picture .
i think there are many in the ted group , i think , already in this ted group .
we &apos;re just playing the cost of production . from ruyfm no lanes .
no important thing happened , the innovation meant that the way it was , was never taken .
so what we need to do on a global scale is to create a new system .

if you want to get 100 percent on it , you need an incredible batch .
sorry . if you get evil , you look away , don &apos;t look .
and then he put it down , &quot; but our water has no inherits . &quot;

i could see it in their eyes , there was shy , life was end .
now i &apos;m going to share with you three things i &apos;ve learned about me that day .
i &apos;m not trying to have any , right ; i choose to be happy .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other targets could be hit by stuxnet .

they harvored carnic meat on what they were in the air .
we doubt from a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in this period , maybe 20 or 25 different kinds of special kinds of sieinds .
it &apos;s an online game where you need to overcome a spine of oil .
nobody wants to change their life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because of the environment .
it &apos;s what we think about people we describe with these words .
so we have to focus on the patology and focus on all the areas of human possibilities .
and the one student is going to be viewing in some tough , better teachers .
these feelings have never , if we play games , play in games , you don &apos;t have it .

one of the things that really cheated is kindness : somebody had a pair of shoes .
i &apos;m just coming back from a community that knows the secret of the progress of human health .
but unfortunately , we have this particular thing embedded in the narrative of human evolution .
so what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical death diagram of age .
when each of you was born in this room , 6,000 languages talked to 6,000 languages .
she was serving sweet and in latin as if you would take a bite from the ocean .
but , if it &apos;s about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it recently : why ?
that means -- you see , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can actually see it with the light microscope .
we &apos;re at six-and-a-half billion people in the next 40 years .
then , of course , there is the whole co2 of that material that landed in the atmosphere .
we conclude in the limits of biological reality and in those of our vision .
these wires are now going to be 13-and-a-half ampl when the machine goes up to the high-performance .
and that leads to less happiness with the results , even though the results are good .
i had better . all of these choices allowed me to have better .
last month , researchers presented that the entire continent has now got negative ice calculates .
four times as many in the last 30 years , like in the previous 750s .
the carsty of the carbs is a happy , happy guy .
in coalerce , we see climate change as a serious threat for our business .

the father of this young man was identified as a tailer of the panf lama .
the family , the fear of his life , had all of us , and all the tools .
what we try to do at national geographic is we think that politicians are never capable of achieving .
of course , the mapping one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
this is a project called photosynth , which is really connecting two different technologies .
that &apos;s what i think there are so few people have engaged , than actually exist .
do you want to make buttons or disclosure ? stone or acid ?
the only real choice was , &quot; who , not when , not what you did after that .
and indeed , you should . these are important questions to answer questions .
an effect , paradoxically , is that it &apos;s paralyzed instead of causing paralyzed .
what could be better ? &quot; it does , &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
he makes an issue about this now , and maybe you just talk about things slowly .
so , in order , now , to hacking biology , you need to somehow be materials .
what &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the nature of nature .
they &apos;re not going to call you that , that would be a little political incorrect .
people always ask me , what did you try to do in adolshard ?
why do we stop to prevent knowledge of something done , if it &apos;s true ?

in israel , you say , if you save a human life , you &apos;ll be saving the earth .
that means our whole intelligence means we want to be dunmber as trees , right ?
this is just the pressure and print , with gutenberg and others .
there are signs , where i know exactly where to grab .
the next generation of the graphic use operations has been working on a lot more with behavior .
so i &apos;m a studing , very much more frequently , behavior than this .
so he doesn &apos;t want to think , but it &apos;s rather making me think , it &apos;s actually making .
and with a kind of pool of light , we can make these virtual worlds visible .
so , you don &apos;t get to eat , just because you can &apos;t book .
so we don &apos;t need to be a caugue tral , we can be a problem positive .
the work of interpreting is similarly to the one of the theater director .
i said yes you need it for the spoken word for the spoken language .
or c , because you hire them to be disditively .
i said , but surely , you can &apos;t tell if you like it or not .
and then , when you do that , you end up with a cy-mass mass destruction .
this is a fact that often provides the increase of incarcerating revenues .
he always saw the window and i could hear the entire tohuwacu .
recession . stay one . docaday , egypt . syria .
you know , tsunamit . speaker 9 : cyberattack
is bin laden &apos;s death leading up a seconden risk of time .

16 terawatts of power collide all 88 minutes on earth &apos;s surface .
he said , &quot; oma , tell all the enyher that you are special . &quot;
and instead of economic advocacy , i see one of the greatest economic statement of history .

she was pushing me so hard that i could barely breathe .
i gave her aspirin . i gave her medicine to take the pressure of the heart .
in the united states , the institute of medicine is actually about 100,000 .

and then in my worst moments , how could i make such a stupid mistake ?
and he knew he &apos;d be able to contribute to you .
seven million people are in terms of currency , or with interconditional punishment .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals for such attacks are not in the middle east .
she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to compromise me three things , bryan . &quot;
are you something that &apos;s a bit quisty , reserve , conservative ?
what &apos;s the makete ? what puppets are at the moment ?

it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t matter .
we then formed a team , a great team , and we started with this .
we went to sao paulo , where the commercial commercials have been subcipated .
the other place was interested in the city environment , singapore .

man 5 : march alcohol writers .
i mean , my brand is fedex because i was a blenerary .

now , this brand , the bandalcomic stadium , the static center ...
in the summer of 2009 , honduras was in the summer of 2009 .
thank you for asset us a scoraneous . thank you ralph .
or even more duzzling of these cities , or hundreds of around the world ?
and so -- here &apos;s the thing : &quot; this box belongs to me .
and with a method of recombination , analog to reproduction . &quot;
there are a number of ways of doing magic , the world and technology .
so you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can put online .
in another chapter , you have to tag a piece of machine and tag .
so you have to tiddle here , and let &apos;s make the light out .
when i met her as a little boy , she came to me and hugged me .
and the school uniform up to the knockles , because she had to pass six years .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , shared several hundred million years .
if we want the institution to work for us , we need to do bureaucracy .
and the most people understand that , but they think that one is input in the other .
it &apos;s a nice little app , where you can adopt a fire hydrant .
we want to bring every single interaction on the world in a costing rock .

and i would invite everybody to do something about it and try it up .
the doctor says a has got these benefits and risks and b , and b has those benefits and risks .

this is actually my meat . it &apos;s not steiastic flute .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both poured down in the idea of happiness .
that will , i think , in the next year or two , will be part of the national statistics .
and in reality , if we fail to fall on obstacles , we tend to feel very different .
they &apos;ve come from &quot; level high &quot; and &quot; + 1 power &quot; or &quot; ph one intelligence . &quot;
no , you didn &apos;t destroy the building ; it &apos;s just that architecture is almost disappearing .
he understood that the medical diagnosis , and how someone dealing with it , two different things .
and the next decade we have another billion players who are remarkably good at whatever .
so i started thinking about what it is to tell us to tell us these games .
i really hope that we play major games to live on this planet another century .
and i was like , &quot; excuse me , sir , sir , we know ? i remember not remember . &quot;
you can &apos;t emphasize enough as critical this factor for a human quality can be .
now look at what happened to what &apos;s happened that day , only in the observing activity that happens in the network .
i myself learned him out of cub scout in the 1970s .
to get to a part of the constitution , it has to be approved twice by congress .
now , when i &apos;m talking about this problem , i &apos;ll ask you some questions and i want to know your answers .
just to give you a look at overview , zoom out to you so you can see what you get .
this is the first object you can see , which was in quantum mechanical position .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
but the amazing thing about the cities is that they are so much more than it is to make it .
now that sounds absurdly for them , as you &apos;ve never thought about in new cities as they &apos;ve never been thinking about .
the brand that i am , i would say , is , dugious , i would say , is a little good fly .
when dan were a brand , he would probably have a classic merceam cabint .
they &apos;ve heard it before , but it hasn &apos;t been true than today that &apos;s more than more .
the categorities have to say something , not the choice for the choice .
michael j. nelson : the mystiscience theater was a joke to twitter with a joke .
the next piece of the puzzle is like a boat in the early more red tub .
for them , life has given her a task : the escape of your family and a new life in australia .
you &apos;re going to make them an upband ? are they something that &apos;s shipping blood in wunduges ?
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this verrover stuff like &quot; logow . &quot;
while we drove out , i had this feeling , being human , to die is not dreadful .
i got another gift , which is to come back into the future and to live back and to live .
if you turn the light on , it looks like we saw it . so it just looks like we saw it .
this can be , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol .
you can have me farmer , or leather , but nobody has ever elected farms .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that this is so often an unbelieving that &apos;s been here today .
and after that , i decided to bann negative energy from my life .
imagine the screen , it could appear in different formats or scales , in different resolution .
how can we keep it longer -- a better fresh , more fresh , three fresh fresh .
what would you do , which you would shoot it up because they think they &apos;re forever ?
so , for example , the number 16 is very drawn from the code , you can &apos;t overlook it .
we need digital security systems where a human machine can respond fast enough .
i thought , &quot; make the camera mean &quot; would mean that we wanted to have a backright conversation .
either flin fusion or a paradise winds , they &apos;re going to have the choice .
and if you want to put the ultimate placebo effect , you have to move to the needle .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique physics range of the song , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
so we also understand , i want to show you a very basic , very simple trick , to show you a very simple , very simple magic trick .
and they &apos;re so designed , by the design that a farmer can simply inhabit them .
you know , there are two countries that are out-extincted to be out-extincted percent of phosphorus worldwide .
and i heard that the archaic model is that we have a principle natural relationship to virtuality .
virtuality suddenly became alien to us , and has nothing to do with reality .
you &apos;ll never forget it , because i &apos;ll show you where the dalcotiner is .
so , in un-to-day , for example , on the gygal rate , they &apos;re intated by the spill of the land@@
in china , a reatoper is going to be honeleks , in some cases , right ?
if you &apos;re out of the opposite , you &apos;ll notice that too and you can get something nervous .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to free ourselves from this very abcuble .
in holland , you understand that in holland , of course , because in holland , the country is building on flowers .
so , it &apos;s about creating a big footprint that will be a wetlands .
and a television set or a washing machine , which you &apos;re using to just give you , the consums don &apos;t use .
an example from a very different region of monet has painted the seglenes machine .
and the child is playing , after a recake , rather than a red flower .
by doing the criminals shake and they move them side-by-side , he can interbine the characters .
here &apos;s it to be the thing we understand under the policial rectacness , and again .
here &apos;s an example . now , those of you who are not new yorkers , i &apos;m sorry .
the more i thought about it , the more i thought about the fish .
but what makes voodoo as interesting is this life relationship between living and dead .
whether he &apos;s a place of mind or a bunch of eret , irrelevant .
and you can &apos;t understand that gllets when you haven &apos;t experienced it on the lower level .
something so profound as our identity is now a question of choice , as this slide should show .
i teach some wonderful social students , and i give them 20 percent less work than i used to .
but we know that when we do that , the social social system are very sensitive .
today , in some flat sells of wood , in the alaska methane of itself , they dressed from the water .
if you break the goldfish glass , so everything is possible , you get your happiness .
this was our first attempting to start , starting with digital information , the genome phi x 174 .
the greeks were called these gothine diet spirits of creativity .
and i want to say , &quot; i &apos;ve been to a point of the jobs for my part . &quot;
in a sense , the arctic ice tiles is the beating heart of our global climate system .
they need this gap to maintain a limb to maintain a victory .
and this is an idea that , if you think about it , can only be satisfied with hope .
and what the marshmallow challenge is is , it helps you to identify in a face .
and the base of the base i think is that the constructioning actually is a commoning sport .
so three very difficult problems that might be resolvable and that &apos;s where it should work .
one is energy density , which is dramatically producing these technologies very much than power plants .
bill gross has a number of companies , including esolar the great solar geographic technologies .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , frantanses and japanese have made something out .
you get an executive administrator on the team , you &apos;ll be significantly better .
but it ended up in the end that i took space scientist with us in the deep ocean .
and this is what you see , that are in the animals right next to a 500 degrees centigrade , that you can survive there .
and not only that , we used to imagine what we have to do to devastate this world .
but this article made me worried , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally i found it out .
we &apos;ve come to at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress in progress like that .
if paul talks in a public audience , he can &apos;t say without weaponhmen waters .
this is the planet we live in . don &apos;t like it , it &apos;s not .
well , in terms of efficiency , the e , the energy per service , is finally good news .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing to be cold and sevent-ful to us that can afford .
that means that 15 pounds of fish are necessary for you to get a pound tuna tuna .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t , what is sustainable about the chicken for the chicken ? &quot;
so , in the sense of the proper load , you have the brilliance of the lie .
but it &apos;s not true , but we have a lot of percent in europe , and we have a physical network that &apos;s the european .
and we just wanted to know what &apos;s happening with a normal , touchly electrochemical battery .
over the last 50 years , we &apos;ve fished the ocean as we were filring with forests .
so , probably , or slaughter , aquacofit , fisheries , part of our future .
and what we can now read a day in the day newspaper , which is that they find that third sentence .
and the preparation were enormous . we had to put cameras and lights and everything .
instead of the water , they actually used the channels to pull the water back .
they do this because they can track the strings of the landway on the land .
no , not because we produce enough calories to feed the world more than just feed .
or do you know , how can we create conditions that make any community capable of feeding themselves ?
so to do that , don &apos;t look at the kind of the future industry model .
and the next piece of the piece is about four women in three generations , which are together a new life .
and in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and i couldn &apos;t even have any man in their treatment .
both are strong undersets because we don &apos;t look at the problem that we should .
during the past three decades , crime rate in america is dedicated to people .
and i think our current philosophy is a philosophy of no helping us .
and also , despite her loarithmic course , you have upset on the left .
three billion new minds we have never heard before will become included , the global communications .
at that point i was the cardiological layer in the cardiology service .
on day day they are going to go -- mri printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
and sometimes , if something comes about ted , it gets meaning and the force that otherwise would not otherwise have .
i spend most of my time with people in research , with prison , or death cells .
we want to get things that are disappeared or things that are no longer that they &apos;re .
because obviously , an animal that was very often going to have happened before it gets out .
so here , i think , the art and the film , i think , is the gap , and maybe simulate the curvements
and the color pecupees and the sweetis remember you might be thinking &quot; avatar . &quot;
and that was an example of how our own governments are using the technology against us , the citizens , to apply them .
the second biggest attack we &apos;re facing today are not motivated by money .
we want to fight bias and discrimination in the criminal justice system .
at the end of every day i was cooking a giant top soup that shared us .
now , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think of something like this .
and they developed special structures that did not work in the organism , as information in the organism .
it will give that little blood printing device that you draw on an iphone or something .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the crows have written last year .
if you know something about governance technology , you know that it &apos;s not that way .
it was a way of able to figure out the parents that are the right public schools to their children .
that &apos;s because the government is like further ocean and politics that are the top-foot .
they don &apos;t fight that battle we all fight , that &apos;s where you &apos;re going to speak ; they &apos;re all allowed to speak .
you might think that &apos;s just a landscape of landscape , and the bottom part was manipulated .
it creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you actually recorded .
as an example , the refined us known as we known from this communication species is human language .
and what we did is , we actually did , mankind , is we have an abstract disk .
it allows us to do things with much higher complexity than the normal methods would allow us to produce .
i came to it when we got our senders and we dream of it .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children with the natural world with their technology .
as a child , i had collections of sticks , stones , and cones and shells .
you put this buzzer for an extra effect on it , and you made a noise machine .
so , using those decisions to form society that is better , the successful being being the more friendier ?
it feels what i want to go and do , where i want to go , and then i end up with my strength and thankers .
this also shows the entertainment value of this talk , so i hope to love that stop .
now , when i was a nice school on college , i had my first biology curses .
evolution is all about the continues of the genome to the next generation , adapt and survive generation generation .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if they could change the cells of their recontinued ?
why not have the quick muscle fibers that will make them faster and longer ?
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- except my physiogeneum .
but if you &apos;re in a epic , and you say , &quot; we &apos;re all out of this . &quot;
and so , by the way , 500 years since he has to say , since he has to say , a very successful introduction .
in new york , i &apos;m a head of the development department of a nonprofit called robin hood .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , about six million years ago .
what are we going to start by saying that we are not different from a few nuclear cleotides ?
the founding fathers were from my point of anatomical activists , which is why .
and maybe we just know what kind of wood we &apos;re taught when we &apos;re really checked .
it &apos;s almost physiological impossible to be bad , if you &apos;re wearing brired pants .
now , if i ever open the folder in the 600 pictures with the 600 images , i would have spent another hour .
and the main lesson we have learned is that they are really different .
and that &apos;s going to be worse , and pretty soon , kids are dying again because that &apos;s just a matter of numbers .
nothing bowns into my slew , or coming out , no servesive . and you can study everything .
we know from the study that one has to reach to a needle when it &apos;s supposed to go .
our memory tells us stories , which means that we have the experiences of our experiences is a story .
so we have the reminself self and the living self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
if you surround the right people , they won &apos;t only understand it , they &apos;re going to appreciate it .
they played a beam game , and then even killed the seed adventure to an epc .
so if you want to miximize the lucky enough of the self , you will be doing very different things .
but in fact , my research at the institute of the institute is exactly the opposite .
you &apos;re not sitting around and roddles . there &apos;s always a very important thing to do .
we know we &apos;re doing optimal as human beings , as we do it hard , meaningful work .
i think players love to be part of the miscourse of depression .
well , just to just conclude , i want to notice that i talked a lot about the fathers .
and that &apos;s because these fanatics who were crazy at all were no fanatics .
they have a choice to move -- shut up , even if it &apos;s against their own , you know .
on the left-hand side , there is jazz and the right on the right is swing , but you know what ?
now i am in front of a favorite pictures , ernkerers of beef breachs in the met .
and this is a great conceptual model in the world , as long as it &apos;s not a partle physicists .
and so they wrote all these observations , and we called them the theory of quantum mechanics .
so we could just simply have the world with duzzy , perhaps hundreds of new cities .
and also , recently , a study by ceos was doing the ceo for a week .
now morgan , the name of transparency : what &apos;s happening to the $ 7100 ?
if someone was asking to describe their brand identity , your brand personality , what would they be ?
the only thing i did is the order of change in that information is given .
jimmy kimmel ended the tweet that made the video last end .
who would predict &quot; double rainstream or &quot; rebecca black &quot; could predict &quot; nyan geror &quot; ?
it was making their way to find the time , to acquire english and it-qualified .
yes , i scared about privilege , pre-diving , priority .
i &apos;m going to start with demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the beginning .
unfortunately , it &apos;s all the good news , because there are a few other problems , and they &apos;ve been reported .
and that sadness formed really in a thought , which i was really wishing to do .
this gray boxle , they don &apos;t devend with windows , it &apos;s completely different technology .
my heart rager was swind while i was trying to figure out what was front of me .
polar mountains are born as a calf of a glacier or just throwing out of ice .
then , one day , he came back from walking and said , &quot; dad , my legs are crirles . &quot;
so basically , what &apos;s worth about this is when you look at something that is impossible , then it can do it .
so , i write for kids , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s first child &apos;s children &apos;s children .
because the lesson that i personally care about this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
so to do things like this -- you know , minds remember in a ban -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we discovered -- made me really shocked out of the socks .
the idea here is obviously not only that the machine engineers are truking over .
so we &apos;re going to sell a shoe and it &apos;s going to sell the greatest shoe you &apos;ve ever had .
who knows if the movie comes out , we can see how a horthly volliopts are .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
but now comes : if you have evidence you have to get this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at all .
and it &apos;s humiliating to think that our species has existed for 600,000 years .
people are going to buck in their faith , and it &apos;s so enveloping that you can &apos;t liberate them .
we won &apos;t answer them immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen , but it &apos;s going to happen right now .
i &apos;ve brought you one example from the north american tribe of nootka india .
40 percent of all the people around the world are getting half their drinking water from that windlight .
so this is the question that was so intuitive to explore and evolved and develop the choice .
this is a game with words that &apos;s a kind of mixture of scdisble and boggers .
i can accelerate the entire sequence of it by the speed of the speed , or the other direction .
and so from the interest of this , i &apos;ve been to this technology , i &apos;ve been to the other time .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he has no pen , he doesn &apos;t have a cassette record .
perhaps an ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and mystery of the creative return .
it sounds very fast , and it sounds very , very fast to science fiction , i know .
all this needs to take our basic ability to accept virtuality as a real habitat .
this is a whole range of things that you &apos;re doing with the actual existence as a form .
because often people are getting , they &apos;re not going to make it friendly so that anyone can handle it .
something that is called a form of law or error of psychology that also affects us in the perception .
but , but again , very rare happened , something happened . one of the siors was actually over-over-over-.
sounds very banal for all of us , but it &apos;s very exciting if you &apos;re getting closer to it .
this is almost to be limited to a total security security -- perhaps for fish , definitely for us .
we &apos;ve been able to spread it around a hundred genes of 500 , or something like 500 , or something , which are here .
we hope that this is not a pop ups and other nonsense -- that &apos;s not necessary .
we have almost an infinite selection of telephones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
instead , they go to the doctor and the doctor telling you , we could make a doable or we could do b .
by the way , there &apos;s a corner i &apos;ll tell no story that i &apos;ll do with the street workplan .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we have missed that dot at a time that we enhanced our common value .
i &apos;m doing it very differently , and i &apos;m making it beautiful , not that it &apos;s better .
that &apos;s great . the roman didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a very common individual .
so we had to develop a new method , and we could put these little pieces together and correct the errors .
the viral particles were then released by cells , and they came back and they killed e. coli .
think about it : we have a 4-letter code : a , c , g and t.
if we think about biological processes or any processes to replace it , it will be a huge challenge .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch them coming over in the next century .
but what &apos;s important about the designers that have the most often semester , the amazing form of nerp laws .
and this is really true to these ideas , these limitations for available available on the screen .
you can see that it &apos;s a kind of a par , often called the reactor wave .
this is like the deadline , which has made us the environmental models that we have to hold .
i never would never get an alien world with a space warship , which seemed to me rather unlikely .
but the ocean is , however , a real ocean , i got to face two years later when we moved to california .
i remembered that last year when i got mosquitoes and sort of liked it .
you &apos;ve told me that they didn &apos;t act , and they &apos;re not going to even leave the glass .
and also , although it &apos;s great , although it &apos;s great , they don &apos;t need fuel -- they have some pervents .
here we see here in this again , again , again , again , again , again , again , the diesel of individual aggregate .
and you &apos;ll get a place immediately , which made it possible for granted , you can &apos;t prove .
it would be like the space requirement , but it does not make it much more important .
there &apos;s a liquid actor that seems to be hard , but maybe they &apos;ll say that over us .
you say that there are negative effects that have to do with the clouds , the things that look different ?
and what peter told us is not only making us do the highest towers but also the most interesting structures of all .
in the rich world there are diseases of the rich world that have threatened millions of us , only one generation of us .
so many people , and look at this , because you can see the problems you get .
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are successes of scientific engineering .
and that &apos;s half of all the water problems in the world that are being created by the textile industry .
so , for learning of music process , for the learning process of music , you need the same thing for the spoken language .
in the last 20 years , five tens of high planion has been distributed on our fields in germany .
because the phosphorus is embedded in the pig , the solids make it extent .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus that really have to go back in circular cycle .
unfortunately , not in closed , but maybe they can take a little bit of the frure .
we have developed a snapshan package , for example , that &apos;s liquid temperature .
so , oversight : now i mean by interacting with the object , again , can zoom out , zooming .
a third sentence that immediately appears in people who have a strong sense of a soul .
unfortunately , i was much too young to see that he was presented when i finally started studying .
well , you see , there &apos;s no way you &apos;re looking at all of the cases , no one has a suberdent candidate .
i want to explain to you today with this mechanism today , or let me just share something that you &apos;re familiar with .
they heard about this book by charles darwin who &apos;s the origin of species and the abundance of human beings .
we need to prevent knowledge of things , and , especially , if they are true .
so for me it seemed to be about being a bit more about the photography at the right time .
and it showed that these days , human females are better folded to the proteins than the best supercomputers .
but before i get to the actual point of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little bit baseball .
this reference is predicted , the money will be predicted in more security quietles , and to invest in safety .
so if we can see the news , we prefer to look out of negative news .
but let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve achieved in the last century so we could have to anticipate the progress .
and to win , the machine needs to make a better diagnosis than a team , highly qualified .
but eventually , i decided to go down to my god , i have to put it into the court and i just put this crazy case
because in this context , we start looking at really amazing things that are making us out of .
in high school , a school student said that brian goldmann would learn to learn a blulet of blood .
if i go into a room -- like now , i have no idea what you think about me .
when i went back to this , the fish was shrunk to half its size .
for example , here &apos;s mr. dimitry golubow from kmed gow in ukraine .
police officers came in and rovered state lawyers and buyer .
so we are proposing our brains because our brains are accepting just not that it makes it really intrinsically .
so in other words , the future has been shrunking by a year since i &apos;m in the world .
and in this context , we put an evolutionary process in the machine that &apos;s going on on the microsecond .
and i think the most important point is that we stopped talking to our patients .
they &apos;re making ways to use easily , that are easily starting to hug patients in the team .
we developed an app for layar , extended reality , to find these aeds .
and like many people , i thought it was mainly about choosing people to get into a office .
so , these are all the tools , and the only thing that we have is the imagination .
in this country , for children &apos;s life lifts of life , there are no conditioning .
we say , &quot; computers , general , please , picked a hundred million randomness random sequences .
now , we are able to reproduce all the remaining ones that are the best sore .
in fact , these programs are so much efficient than any program i &apos;ve ever had from hand .
i loved my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , grandmother , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
it &apos;s estimated over 400 billion still -- or 75 rocks for every person on this planet .
we have this banner in our office in palo alto , it sounds like we should understand the future .
and the last game we &apos;re going to do at the 3rd of march . it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
but not only does any mission , but a mission which is perfectly good to your current level in the game , right ?
and then there &apos;s this epic story , this inspire story , why we are there , what we have to do .
because if we could figure that out , we would never have done anything that has been able to be human potential .
his work is genius . he explored why people spend so much time , energy and money in online worlds .
so he says that this is actually useful , because players can do more in online worlds than real life .
but danny , in the entire american ascens , is about life , freedom for happiness .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people in california are they not get the correct answer .
our language is in the future of social change , which have been disaccted in many cases through a technological change .
wide-doties are not obstacle that we need to get into order to get our lives better .
and we don &apos;t like our kids if we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt .
maybe that &apos;s the meaning of wide-life , one perception of the iphone , a sense of the iphone , the sense of our own power .
and i hear a guy behind me , &quot; well , that &apos;s not what the aib mullins is . &quot;
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough enough to solve the most pressing problems in the world .
and you will all get nutrients that you could just want to wish without fighting the effort to put in .
and you can go to the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here , and now you &apos;re going to stay here .
they have made the demographics of the earth in a way that has ever been done .
they lie , they &apos;re confused , they &apos;re confused , and they really produce dispute .
so the performance is to work with prototypes , so far -- but let &apos;s see how different teams are doing .
if you have 10 teams that are typically going forward , you get about six , which have more robust .
if anybody had had a 2.5-inch construction , he would have been wearing the prize .
the challenge is a common experience , a common language , and it &apos;s a basic , very proven .
they live in the deep congolties of the congolese urge , and they are just hard to see .
it &apos;s about how satisfied or inhappy person is when this person thinks about their lives .
echinese acea , a little antioxidancy to get you down .
you know , in the next 50 years we &apos;ll have to grow 70 percent more food than the moment . 70 percent .
we can move them where we want to move them , and we &apos;ll move where we want .
i know we can , and we can , as far as i &apos;m concerned , is something that the world needs now .
it &apos;s actually sistin in his place that i can shake it without moving the knife .
if a spirit has about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new new shapes .
and , although it seems really simple , it &apos;s really hard , because it really pushes people working very fast .
i &apos;m going to zoom in to one of my favorite strike of this image , until i really am in the cracks .
each of you , every -- equally bad , or poor , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t play it .
and every time i interview someone , i can say , &quot; are you ugly enough for this interview ?
i have to talk to the man who &apos;s like me , who is like me , otto is more consumers .
well , that film festival , in the sundance film festival , we can look at this .
those of you who are really interested in art can sit here -- but i click this away .
this is one of the photographs we &apos;ve been stuck with with the gigapix-technology technology .
it turns out that it was actually meant : &quot; we want nothing to do with your film . &quot;
some of you may have heard that i took an ad in ebay a couple of weeks ago .
you can go and create your own museum -- from all of these pictures , you can put their own collection .

a season , if you &apos;re doing the crowd with water , the enough pressure , i think , so that i can possibly get to six to six hundred pounds .

i spend most of my time with socially weakatives in the social state settlements and in places where there are a lot of hopeessness .

you have a fantastic language and a marriage account that the linguistic exogamy is called : you need to marry somebody who talks a different language .
and maybe we &apos;ll make it , wicing , to see , wide-bends , and useful to see and feel ourselves in their presence , no longer as sink .
and we then haven &apos;t got involved , but that &apos;s not what i think has been a pretty good , so people are right now , people are right .
so you can see , i &apos;m going to develop my desire to develop new human-computer interface , to be able to fit the way our brains and bodies work .
right now , we &apos;re building maize , and we lose up between 11 and thirty and thirty tons of a hectare , or on the square meters , you &apos;re able to calculate .
that means we only projored our sight before we see it , and we put it back into our secular equipment to say , okay , okay .
it &apos;s about how you have seen people in interactive media so that they can use these interactive media and make it a chance to create satisfying experience .

we will turn it on , and expect the first data in june , and july , and we &apos;re putting together , and we &apos;re putting our journey to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
and his job is to create the conditions that existed less than a billionth of a second at the beginning of the universe -- and that &apos;s up to 600 million times within a second .
that means that the interpret must be in the unmenting information of the language language , which is audible , concrete , nonverbal language .
we actually start from a new point : we have digitized biology , and now we try to go into a new phase of biology by building new life .
there are a number of people who have a lot more &quot; uh-oh &quot; moments than others , and under the worst is the freshures are an all-class woman .
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years -- think of a column -- you think of it , without all the complexity .

we need to be doing these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go into the time machine and get a happy future , we will be doing a happy thing .
and i was amazed to reject , on the resistance of what is the most effective thing in health history in human history .
and sometimes a small prototype of this experience is everything that it takes to take us from a &quot; uh-oh &quot; moment .

so i was back with a little team at an unknown terrain , and we turned out to be avatar with a new technology , which hasn &apos;t happened before .
because we did all of this with only 10 to 12 people , the years of uninterrupted , and sometimes we were in two to three months in sea .
and something interesting happened . what &apos;s interesting about jacques cousteau &apos;s shows was fascinated to a very unknown world here on our earth itself .
and many discussions i &apos;ve had in the last six years were kind of like the discussion i had in the last six years , in the subject of photovoltaics .
we want the world of the creation , the inventor , the contributive , because this world in which we live in , these interactive world , belongs to us .
and finally , saturday : a single unique , personal style , to develop a great , unique style , is a great way to tell the world without having to say a word .
if you look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he gives us a dream called a kind of a solution , a kind of solution .
when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i went to this very exclusive store , at least at the time , really exclusively .
the director of congress came on stage and he said , &quot; professor roter , thank you very much for your talk , but could we probably watch the tedtalk .
and so i look at myself as one of the people , with the most experimental bists , who provide a good amount of logic to bring together the complex ideas together .
so when i started talking with companies and told them that we wanted to tell the story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
i sent some facebook news stories , some twitter messages , and i gave people the opportunity to stand the name of my tedtalk 2011 .
and if you &apos;ve ever got the drug tag , the one of the spones of college and high-tech , let me tell you this : the use of use is a science for yourself .
well , if you do it , people bought six times more of a glass of marmelt , who you had six to spend after if they had a choice .
i love to find a different far-violent , crazy outfit , and in the last time too , i also do too photographing and blogging .
and it turns out that when you manage something to do , it feels a very good tool , so you can get people saving more .
one of the areas we see that shows that in our modern culture , in our modern culture , are the fighting for the beginning and the end of life .
many journalists would get me with the question : &quot; what are you going to do that will tell us if caster semenya or male is in trouble ? &quot;
and i &apos;ve been working very often with internal people whose sex is -- so people who have not demonstrating the average male or female group .
but they also also have a secret for our future , a future in which we have to adapt to more surplus challenges , by greater creativity and printing cooperation .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us research , and we interact with it , and the unexpected link that we create are the actual resource of creativity .
so we &apos;re not only responsible for people that we love to keep frulchs sweeping , but prepare to be good at reasonably well .
so one day i decided to go to the filigenter , and i asked the head , &quot; does this model prove that you really provide all of these things ? &quot;
so they invented , according to the dototus , the box game , and agreed with a national strategy , and one day you would be able to play .

and if you &apos;re familiar with the works of the ancient greek historian , you may know this story . the story about how and why games were invented .
at nine people we &apos;ve been executed , one that we have conceived of being innocent , and released and issued the death cell .
unlike the other 20th century , the community &apos;s converge is to become the community of this phenomena -- either by making it distributing or making something new out .
now , please ask all of those , the instructions , the instrucints , the all programs , and the vote eventually ends the ones that i &apos;m at the next . &quot;
so we take something very complicated , we transform it into sound , a sequence of sound , and it makes something very complicated in the heads of others .
but then , one other one happened , very interesting step , where things were completely different , and they began to communicate and share information so that communities from cells form .
so an app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then spread out of sellifce is a kind of fancy in the state of the government .
but it could also be used to get people out of their roof , and to get them to play in all sorts of a way to control their health .
and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew i had several months to plan it , to go find the different places for the puzzle .
and imagine i &apos;ve even negotiated that as fifth as fifth child with dr. p. &apos; how , trying to stop these lessons , natural , no offense .
and in each step , we have a commodity and sequence these things so that we could sequence them , because we were trying to create a very robust process to see what you &apos;ll see in a minute .
and this is not an intuitive inability of instructive , not until apple is a fundamental economy , in general success , if i want to make a technological device to humans .
and there we are , and we &apos;re going to have trouble campus , which is the virtual reality in our v.r. lab , we can actually do this all the time .
i told my wife , always when a man is being used in a moral jale , using the word , we should try to replace it through replace the word even though replacing it .
at this point , and if you &apos;re laughing , you realize how important this lie is and how much time you need to learn something , what artists can tell us to do well .
i can now see the sound notions that the stream has done on the modern wing , which is a baroze of carobala .
it &apos;s already out of translation in english , and it can require more knowledge , and it can require more knowledge , once when you leave it , when you do it , you know , poetry .
and of course , if we succeed , we can &apos;t suffer for adidas for nike , for posthand , for postritz and the whole textile industry .
you need to imagine that when you make something the classical sovim , you need five hours and you have this new kind of natural software just for an hour .
and so in berlin , we &apos;ve decided to build a hall in berlin where we can sort of put the electrical material of the island in the measure of three , three very precisely .
so in the old time , you know , who has a village with whom to and when , this is what happens to whom , through this expansion , is happening to this expansion of these mobile devices in a global scale .
and our european connected net is basically made of lauck-rotating masses of large power plants , where the wave all around europe is spinning across europe .
i think that molecular biology generally exists , so generally , biotechnology , everything you count to make synthetic biology and so forth .
i &apos;m a making . i must be able to work at the same time and sweating , and really unpleasant , and really unpleasant .
a process that -- as everybody knows who ever has tried to do something -- in other words , in other words , is actually everyone here -- not always recommended .
because it makes a lot of sense as anything that i &apos;ve heard , when it &apos;s about explaining the totally crazy quality of life in the process of the process .
so , there it is . and for those of those who haven &apos;t been here at the time , the lhc was the biggest scientific experiment ever made -- 27 miles in the diameter .
we now have , from our discoveries around the world , a database of approximately 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future .
no , it looks much better , it looks much better if we show that we &apos;re all on to eradicate the dangers , the other ones will ever reach if they just fire fire .
and i argued that we might have this new set of cambrian explosion in which there might be massive new dimensions based on this digital design .
the other note says whether we &apos;re using the zero emissions technology , whether it &apos;s deployed in all the developed countries , and we &apos;re being on the way of getting them to the rest .
we had to do that at the time . when we read a book , we took the description of the author and they did it on the screen in our heads .
if you play , you &apos;ll see some nuclear things that go up in the eyes of a few eyes and your mouth are a sign of optimism . the eyebrows show surprise .
and what happens is , if you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and this difference is , say , climate .
if i told you that somebody has been in the same age of eight , they &apos;ve got a lot of insecurity about how happy it is with his living self .
what that means is that if you were to meet somebody and you would say , oh , his father is a two-foot man , how much would you know about your size ?
now , i &apos;m constantly listening to lots of chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture , we don &apos;t want to have a huge field of fields of thing , which is wrong .
bg : well , the actual expense for research -- let &apos;s spend the u.s. government 10 billion a year more than they &apos;re doing -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
but also , it turns out , because it turns out , by using all this time , we &apos;re actually able to use what we do as people are capable of .
film studio , i have this as &quot; romeo and juliet on a ship , and it became a love movie epic experiment , a passionate movie .
yes , it &apos;s a huge debate right now to build the coal &apos;s power for the coal , because we don &apos;t have to , or gained , because that &apos;s not .
we can go beyond a step further and then we can see the data then , and we see that rovasmins and cancer are the usual suspects , but not everyone .
they &apos;re stressed out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all you see is flooded channels and that density , flying march .
now , i was not carmed with a few people in the company . nobody could give me an indicous answer , until finally i finally had the senior biologists .
90 percent of the big fish who we love , the tunas , the faithal , the lapys , the nugts , the nugts , they &apos;re glad , they &apos;re all broken .
we got to talk about music , and a few days later , i got an email , which said that nathaniel was interested in mutual children .
so in discussions , in discussions , trying to do this insuit , making it self-returns , they have a little small web , which has already with our verbal nothing .
well , in egypt , the outstanding in april of 2011 , the headquarters of egyptian intelligence agencies , and they found a lot of acts .
and so far as isolation goes from planet devastating planet , it will be isolated and the changes of the environment that will produce evolution naturally produce natural ways .

so , gender is really complicated ; it &apos;s not just a very complicated phenomenon in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , you can get rid of the whole range .
and in this scenario , imagine that in one case the sperm is a y chomol , which keeps the x chromosome of the ega .

a few weeks later , the fire guard received a letter of houaborate , where she was regarded for the bailon of life for the rescue of rescue for her house .

my wife , my kids and i , went to the garage , and these hackers and programmers and convirations and convirations and the conviruts have taken over .

the second is a conversion of experience and memory : essentially it &apos;s between happy in your life and happy , and it &apos;s about happy with its life or happy with his life .
but i think that in this frame here , and the purpose of making a real thing , i &apos;m going to just leave the needle in there and just walk through the stage .
so i have a company called design and animation , graffiti so necessarily , a complex part of what we admire in the art world and also appreciate .
and from my view , the scientific method is to test things , see if it works , it changes , it changes , it will change one of the greatest achievements of humankind .
the interesting thing is that this slide , like this , is how this slide is like this , is a way of looking at a semi-logg curve .
and there &apos;s a generation that has grown up to the internet , and that knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you need to build the right systems .
and that &apos;s what i got you home , and i missed a quiet voice in me trying to say , &quot; whoman , no good idea . aren &apos;t that . &quot;
i may as well be as successful as i was able to take up and to take responsibility that i was so attended and so on to do my patients without the contamination .

as it would feel , in a world where the german state was going to put people , especially when there was a lot of jews , many jews would be .
we progressively know that 10 years from now , the rate of the yoviation of the civil honor is going to be as high as before the election rule .
and luckily , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of them , and we need hundreds of , and that &apos;s when their places work , you can offer for that .
and if you manipullate the speed of that rotor , you actually have to crack the rotor and then explode the centrifuge .
and because the government finally pushed their power out of us -- remember , &quot; we &apos;re going to affect the people ? &quot; how we think about it will affect how this change happens .
and there were rare chughts of &quot; silent eye &quot; and here , i had paintings and powbing , &quot; asian , go home . &quot;
my first memories are from this boat -- that &apos;s the trageoc of the motor , the clapping of every wave on the bug , the long and the empty horizon .
and these scientists have just documented the different subjects that they have been doing with curding , and how much time you spent doing decisions that are related to the issues .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion in a place when it gave a break , octavio said , &quot; paul , could we probably watch ourselves the tedtalk . &quot;
i think &quot; fresh &quot; is a super word that this category really makes place to something positive , versus fighting for punishment and mosture . &quot;
now , it &apos;s good , except for the fact that paul is walking around vaccines and says how valuable you are , and that people simply stop behaving .
this is ayahuesca , which many of you have heard of , the most powerful psychoactive precire of the repertoire of the shame .
and yet , the burning of coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , which is remarkable clean coal-tech technology you see here changes .

he was talking in a very hot and well-known sound about yo-yo ma and hillary clinton and how the dodgers would never build into baseball world &apos;s lines , and all of this was going to be the slict passage of the first mind of beethoven &apos;s fourth sentence .
bill gates : to run the simulation on a supercomputer , get all the great scientists what we &apos;ve done , we need a few 10 million . and even if we &apos;ve tested our materials in an russian reactor to make sure that it works in a hundred million million .
you know , as michelangelo , the mozy shaped , says he took the hammer to the end of the hammer and he would put him on moses , and actually he would see a little bit of inherirory -- and said , &quot; haché non parli ? why do you think you &apos;re

it really works , that &apos;s going to be in academic choction , and we thought , okay , we &apos;ll get that , then we took a microcam , which was put up , and then you have a microscope that was put up , and then you have a microscope that was expanding , and then you have a microscope that was expanding , and
the first is , if you get a child , when you &apos;re a baby , you &apos;re doing what the bottom line you have , you know , what the pardivores you got , you know , and nurding the pockets , the more , their curiosity will fail with it .

in this image , i have a bush of branches laid in all directions , because if you look at the constraint tree of life , all the places that are indicated on the tips of the tree , in evolutionary terms , they have survived , it has been provocally given to its environment .

&quot; cloud-computing , &quot; something my friends at autodesk call infinit-computing computing , sensors and networks , 3d printer , allowing it to democratize the personal production on our planet , synthetic biology , fuel , drugs and food , digital medicine , nano-materials and artificial intelligence .
that &apos;s what really looks like , if you do that , agriculture makes biogas , on a hectare of land at five-hour rural , can allow you to get a farmer about one-2--100 dollars , and then you &apos;re waiting with that , chickens and pig and fishes and fishes and fishes and fishes and fishes and fishes and fishes and fis@@
we &apos;re at the threshold , amazing events on many areas , and yet i really think we need hundreds of , 300 years before the enlightenment to find a time in which we have been fighting progress in more frontless ways than now .

but we wanted to go beyond that . we wanted to build a full bacterial chromosome , and it has more than 580,000 letters of genetic code , so we thought we &apos;re building it in cassette , from the size of the virus , to see what the single component of a living cell is .
you know ? i think a single person will allow to allow that he or she is like the vessel and the essence of all the gods and the essence of all the govine , creative , unknown , infinite myths is a little bit too much good to them to raise a fragilasting , human psychology .
so by looking in color , contrast and helvity to the edges that represent individual images , then add a lot of microems like a crat , uncut color , like a field of rock , and then we can see it as a single picture , and then we can see it as a single picture , although a picture is basically contain it .

i was afraid not to , not necessarily , but i was afraid i could lose him , that he could sink into one of his circumstances , and i was able to destroy his relationship with the spirits , if i started talking about broad5 and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didatic mudiocomive .

if you &apos;ve ever got the chance to work in your urban call center , like our fellow scott silgman as part of the program -- in fact , they do all of that -- you &apos;ll see the people , the government , the government is put in different problems , including that a thylacer is in their house .
and from a conversation this morning with dean kay , one of the innovators of the do she , i want to share with you a little bit -- he gave me the permission -- his technology , the &quot; slingshot , &quot; and many of you have heard about it , it has the size of a coolline in the middle of the students .

i had written this piece of &quot; avatar &quot; that should send the proven into plastics and computer-generated effects on new heights , with realistic human beings , expressive figures , with the cg of human , and the main figures that were made by cg .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economically , and at the same time , the skeptic will say , &quot; okay , i &apos;m not interested there , i &apos;m not interested there , but i &apos;ll accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
now , what happens today , if you want to win a race , actually -- something that &apos;s going to monitor the car in real time , a few thousand sensors , has a few thousand sensors that have information from the car , and then they &apos;re going to change it and then use things to send back to this car and change things in real time than information is collected .
the result is -- we call it autonomy , and it sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift diffiter for the people &apos;s choices -- being a bit of a review , but not in the best constitution is a decision to make -- namely , the patient &apos;s constitution-person is a decision to make -- namely , the patient &apos;s .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magic , which believed that it was literally living into the walls of an artist &apos;s office -- about like dobby , the house -- the wheelage -- the shuch out and the artist in work , in a sense , would be assisted , sort of , under-invisible and to work with the work .
this idea saved me as i was in the middle of the writing process of sag , pray , love , and i fell into one of these empies of the two-doubt we all fall when we work on something and it doesn &apos;t work . you start to think that it will be a dessebe desseration . it will ever be written .
we also have one of these same aggregate in the same size as it is there , in the hall , in fact , to actually put the full dynamic behavior from that web , so in the half-way that this is the big battery , here &apos;s the big battery that we simulate the net .
if i want to explore one thing today , the whole thing we consume is that the whole thing we consume is larger than the sum of its parts and instead of all of the information overlap , i want you to think about how we can use information , that the pattern of the things we see is we &apos;re going to be able to be able to use this , that pattern and we recognize so trends that
so in a study i did with shlomo benartzi and alessandro , we &apos;ve done a study with the people at work -- employees that worked for work -- and these people were all in a gathering in which they &apos;ve sent their participations to their retirement savings .
not a biologist would claim to say that 50 percent or more of all species are extinct , because it just isn &apos;t true , and yet , this -- the apocalyptic slararium on the area of biological diversity .
the computer vision algorithms together held these images together in the same room that these images that were all set near the grassi lakes in the canadian rock , representation-the-hand elements of storami and panoramonic imaging and these things all around the relationship .
and then partly , if you &apos;re in part , the software we just saw has come forward , you &apos;ll understand why near-fair-ninty percent of our planet software is intuitive or not for usury , even though it &apos;s actually a lot more intuitive than classical software .
bg : well we haven &apos;t just appeared on a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting openness for everything that &apos;s being contributed to the &quot; nuclear &quot; in the name of the name , and there &apos;s great interest and i &apos;ve been talking about how this fits to energy agenda , and i talked about how this fits to energy agenda .

i recommend to you , steering book read or watching the movie so that they don &apos;t just understand the wonderful connection that was developed between those two men , but also the music that they were working when that thing was needed , that the way that it was that the play is , if that thing is a play that was going to be doing that .
and so , there are different , but the beauty of it is that a uranium has a million times as much energy as one , say , a coal molecule , and that &apos;s mainly the radiation , the impact of the land and other things , almost in a single liga .
so we have a situation where we have the further science science perpetrates , we need to be more engaged , that these categories that we &apos;ve had to be more stable for us to create permanent identity , much less injuries than we suppose we have .
so i went home and i ate dinner with my wife and told her about everything , and we thought , &quot; well , wait a second , if this technology is there to control your eyes to control things , then we want to find a way to do that , that &apos;s a maffiti , that would be a duffiti . &quot;
and as i was in thinking of modulmodels last year , i &apos;ve also been looking for the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see if they were able to help other societies to see whether they could help with the emotional risks with the emotional risks that were connected to creativity .
bruce brown , a famous design researcher at brighton university , has gone so far to say that these mass media , he means the book , the image , the internet , so on the tv , is not the tv , the internet , and so on , what we might call a mass media today that this mass media has been hired today , and has obtained our ability to virtualize our capabilities .
it was just a simple trick of dr. p. , so i do the practice that i didn &apos;t do to become the plenty of five year-olds in the clinic , but actually made me to see my everyday turin horror . so , it actually made me to see my everyday turin horror .
that sentence is living by the infute of the idea that success or happiness depended on a challenge to solving , without being driven by this , without being driven by the interability . as if my life was so successful , because i could pass the case from a life with a prosthetic , or whatever people can perceive with my disability .
i mean , some happy people and companies , for-profit and nonprofitable , they got the opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson never got this -- the very first thing that &apos;s going to be -- is to buy a title of that , not many evidence , to buy what the subject would be .
and when those individuals came and watched who is the best win-to-the-world , this wasn &apos;t a chamal professor , it was somebody from england , manchester , a woman who was a nur-to-day person &apos;s life teacher and was the best protein recorder in the world .
here , in the picture , you see the lab , in aspowering , so it &apos;s such a contest garage with some of the kinds of lab division that university has been embedded , a group in paris , who &apos;s done what was set up and quite successfully done , and also really makes a project .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering , the draper prize for francis arnold and wilson catosautt , two scientists who developed independent techniques , had to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and to make the use of the natural proteins in a more efficient way -- which frances calls arnold .
and now , they &apos;re currently seed to biology , and i want to take this metaphor that comes out of synthetic biology , and that biology is actually an abstract science science because , you know , it &apos;s a kind of abstract code , so the d.t.a code is an abstract code , because it &apos;s a matter of the matter
that made me to another other person as my friends under the kwakiutl , who believe that these forests of the conviction of hukuk and the bowning celebratory system are the unicued and the sea &apos;s locks that are involved in the nordikai initiation .
and they were then lining two two legs and said , o.k , we make easy and cheaper , and then we just have open open , and then we have just the cheapest acre , and the electron things are put together and now the cheapest acre of those devices around the world .
woman parks kept coming back to montgomery , where she &apos;s got two of their oldest friends , and this elderly women , johnnie carr , had been trained to do the montgoma bush , an incredible afric woman -- a tremendous afric woman -- and virginia , who said .
these people are now being laid up to travel , but they have suffered it illegal by using trojans to claim money from our bank banking while we &apos;re going to do our online banking , or we &apos;re also buying keylogers , which collected our credit information in input .
what my role is , is , to explain to people how wonderful the technologies , which are going to be coming up at the outcome , will be , and i thought , because i &apos;m here among friends , i would tell you what i really think . and i thought , &quot; try and understand what &apos;s happening here , with these incredible leaps for the meetings that are going to happen , that we can
it means that a little child from the adolance that grows in the faith is an apin mind , or its own destiny , will be a very different person , and a different relationship to that resource , and that is a very different child , and a different relationship to that resource , and that is a little child from a montana , who can be ducked up .
we cleaned the chromosome of a micro-species , roughly said , are these two exotheralities from each other , as people and mice -- we took some extra genes to help us take this chromosome , and it was very amazing when we gave it into a cell -- and they &apos;re going to deploy some of the very sophisticated boxes in there .
i had recently met an encounter when i met the extraordinary american diet in ruth stone , who &apos;s now 90 , but was diving her whole lives , and she told me that she was in the villages of the landscape , she said she would feel and hear how a poem was going to be bounded around the landscape .
and so , the idea of this is that , now , if you have all kinds of urgent issues , you &apos;re going to invest in something that has been something later -- and it &apos;s coming out , that investment is not quite clear . in fact , this is a big drama .
and that would be your answer to the b.local lomborg argument that if you &apos;re using all this time and energy to solve co2 , all the other goals that poverty reduction , all the other goals suffiding poverty , and so on that there &apos;s a dumb waste of resource , money to spend money in the while making better things we can do .
in other words , on mutups , in some studies , they &apos;ve shown a measurable effect to demonstrate placebo effect , and only because the person thinks what happens to you is a measurable effect in the body that &apos;s called the placebo effect .
margaret mead , the great anthropologist before she died , that it &apos;s its greatest fear that , as we move towards a subject , more sophisticated , generalized world view , we would have a confirmed way of being able to wake up in a thoughtful , more , more general , general world .
this is a reconstruction of cathedral notre notre , which was exposed to the computer with pictures of flickr , just composed , just give a place to the notre of the flickon and on the university campus and so on , and you get the picture of men &apos;s cotton and on the university campus and on the university campus and so on . every one of those entitle-beared
if you had a no one , the vetopian cattle , which has a very disclosure , i &apos;ve helped a hard time for 10 years to let me go off whether i really had a great engineering to do this , because all of my father &apos;s colleagues were always admitting him to the window of your child , you &apos;ve cut the money out of your child .
now let &apos;s step back to the time of the big bang , 14 billion years ago -- the earth that &apos;s about four and a half billion years ago -- the first evidence of living creatures , perhaps three and four billion years ago -- the first evidence of living organisms , perhaps three or a billion years -- and then human species , which are formed in the last 13 years .
and yet , in this country , in the state of the old south , we &apos;re building people -- here &apos;s the risk of being death , 11 times when the victim is , like , when the cropped is the black , it &apos;s 11 times higher when the victim is , as if it is black . 22 times when the people were input , it &apos;s a little bit higher .
i was a little young colleagues , 6,000 miles from chick in westchina , from the south tibet to lhasa , and not when i came to lhasa , i saw the face behind the statistics that you hear about 6,000 sacred monuments that were murched and seaf . 1.2 million people who were murdered during the cultural revolution .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about one of the original data sets of noah and this is from an early prototype of photosynth that we first worked on in the summer , to show you what i think is really the punchline behind this technology , the photosync technology , and this is not necessarily as obvious as you see the environments that we have on the website .
and to show the dimension , i have all sorts of batteries that are made of , which for cars , computers , cell phones , tadabs , for everything . and i found that with the amount of electronic energy that uses the world , it could be used less than 10 minutes of total energy .
a few years ago , the laser prize of the scientist shinya yamanaka gave me to his research in his research in his study he took a adult partner , a fibrochure , and by the manipulation of just four genes , the cell induces the cell in your body .
if you go back to land and say , &quot; we had to do it , the fiberglass &apos;s fiber and the mess around that you can never explain , all the technology , the difficulties , the kind of , the human performance , if you can never explain it . it &apos;s like the policeman or with the soldiers who have gone through and know they can never explain it .
well , if you are one of these who are not proof of biological evolution , this would be a very good moment , to switch your attention , take your personal communication device -- i &apos;ll give you the permission -- and maybe you can take a look at kathryn schultz &apos;s book , which is what &apos;s about being wrong because nothing else is going to be doing any other sense of this talk .
and so i ended up with the people who were interested in space and doing the nasa and the nasa &apos;s intellikest and real space crosses , and you &apos;re going to go through the real world &apos;s intellikings and you &apos;re going through the real world &apos;s understandings , and you &apos;re going through the mission to go through the international world space and take our 3d camera stampage .
in my show , white coat , black way . &quot; i have to say the habit , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would be able to tell him any one of the buveassigists to the cardimate , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; what about her ? &quot; and then i &apos;ll show you the microphone .
for example , women used the right to fight the vote , the concept of greenetfathers , which says that anatomic commonality is more important than the anatomic difference , and said , &quot; we said we have a mother and an egitlout than a difference , etc . , etc . &quot;
now we all use , or many of us , gmail or one of your competitors , but these services are especially suburban in total alitarian states such as iran , where they &apos;re using foreign indoors , and they &apos;re pred on ssingconnections so that the local government can &apos;t sniff it over their talks .
i even have my professor , richard evan shulte , who &apos;s informed the magical nuredelic nurea of the magical mushrooms in mexico , discussing that in the 300s , i argued that you couldn &apos;t actually have a hallucination in the game that you could never be in the moment that you can &apos;t feel there .
many of you will know the story , because from stealen article , ran a book that was filtered again with robert downey junior when steve lopez and jamie foxx had been found as a native , and a very promising career of talking about his paranoid schizopony , who was under-performing career and a lot of time through his paranoid schizopony .
it doesn &apos;t stay much room for asbat or the cold flows from tibet , and yet , they have shaped a secret nimz from the earth , but still shaped a secret nimz of the earth that doesn &apos;t occur on the idea of being close , but on a far more subtle intuition , the idea that the earth can only exist because they &apos;re drawn into the human mind .
so the system is going to be developing backcops that make it easier to make up mistakes , and it &apos;s possible to create the delivery , supporting spaces , to create spaces that care in health care , and actually to replace things that are going to be rewarded , and specifically for people like me , who are making the mistakes of the grainer .
so , a lot of success story , of course , we have a problem of a growing company and we have two thousand thousand , decided that we start and go back to a small group , decided that we start and go back again to the next subject of the future , which is to say that people will start to start the ganking , that &apos;s all right again to start again to start with the next subject of the future , which is what &apos;s going to happen to me , and then to
if someone has done mothering and it has all these holy scripts and shares who you are , then my photo is going to be a little bit of the notre of the day cathedral , with all this data , and i can use it as a starting point to come in this room , and i can use it as a starting point to come in this room , into this metaverts , which is a sort
i &apos;d like to end with a poem that was refined by a persian poet called hafiz in 14th century , and that &apos;s what my friend jacques fed in , and that &apos;s called &quot; the poem , &quot; the god , the only four words , and repeatedly repeatedly , he always said : &quot; come , come with me . &quot;
it &apos;s said , at this point , jaids to octvio said , &quot; what happens if we &apos;re picking a blank surface of our country -- what if we &apos;re just picking them out of a single american embassy part of our country , what if we &apos;re just going to go to canada , or america , can they work , and can do it on the surface of this messages , what they are usually going to go to canada or america ? &quot;

so , i &apos;d like to summarize that to you my talk , in the sense that the qualities and the skills that we &apos;ve acquired of the age of age , and have gone back a little bit of a little bit of a shrushed , a bit of a machine age , that we can actually see the way we call the cyber age , and we &apos;re actually getting back to our rovers .
as an computer biologist , inspired by the kind of our interaction with real objects -- with my colleague , with my colleague , and my colleagues jeevan kalanithi , i began to wonder myself : what if we could intervene the computer , that would be a little bit of a ping-el-eater , which is a slight place -- -- what if we could intervene with both of our hands and how to reach it so appropriately , how do we want to intervene with
and if you have people who are in persuasion , that they have a soul , or you can also say that they were grown from the soul to life , they
at the end of this amazing discovery , you &apos;ll eventually break out to the outside and eventually in your life , at age 18 , look at a sunrise . and in that crystal sound moment of consciousness , you see a sunrise . and the priest of consciousness comes back and says , &quot; you guys ? it &apos;s really what i &apos;ve learned to learn .
one of them is to be from the great choices of different salatbands , if you shop , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what salatwork is , is perfectly perfect -- and what salatwork is , is perfectly perfect ? it &apos;s just a different decision to have that they were making a decision , and what happens is that , in a salad , that &apos;s negative to happiness that they made of their choction , that they were in the case that it was a good decision .
really , what i found was that he collected contemporary sections of my childhood childhood , whether i won in a second class in the second class , whether i &apos;d won with a letter competitive in the second class , whether i &apos;d come up with the polarship or one of my sports sectacs , no matter whether i had a felumenter or one of my sports sectacs , and he used this slip to educate his students , medical students from
and we do a series of travel into ethnosphere that we take in our audience to the other place that they &apos;re going to take into the crowd of sparked subbitives , and hopefully , they will be informed by one another , that we can find a life of the anthropology , that this world has earned to exist in many ways that we can find a life of life in a truly multicalized world .
i will leave my final words to an english scientist . humphrey davy , who i suspect when he defense the useless experiments of his teacher &apos;s uslings , his teacher was to assume that we &apos;re not a mystery in nature that we &apos;re not there to do with a mystery of our human mind , as an assusion that our scientific principles are , that there is no mystery that our compound are poised in nature , that our science shows is not that
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s about the penan in the borneo forest , or the voodoo acids in haiti , or the warneos in haiti , or the warneos in haiti , or the warneos in the cundane desert of northern kenya , and this happens to be a colleague of paris that traveled to the desert a month ago , or even a yaki shepherd on the lower of the sahara , and it happens to be a col-hander on the lower of the qomenter .
you can look at the medical point of view , of course , that my legs , the laser surgery for visually impaired , knetilist chainings , titan , artificial hip for aging body , allowing people to actually use their own choices and envasing them to the world that &apos;s really unexpected to be able to use the pro-to-social , and enpecating the borders around the world .

just knowing that jamatic shamanes are still going beyond the milky way or the importance of the elders of the inuit , or that the guolosts &apos; sense of the inuit are increasingly relevant , or that the himalayas is still relevant to the guharma , is to keep the central epiphany of the dharma , which is to recall the central epiphany of the dharma , which is the idea that the world we live in , not in absolute meaning , but only as a consequence of a single group of adaptive adaptions that we have in
what ayahuesca makes so fascinating is not only pharmaceutical potential of preparilals , but it &apos;s really being done , it &apos;s really made out of two different sources . on the one hand , this is the wooden lit liane that has a series of intapadyines , which is a series of intapa-coline , which is a series of intapa-coline , which is a series of intapa-coline , permissions . these climber plant is something like a wish-rargstroke smoke , it &apos;s a little bit more like a black steam rit on her mind , it &apos;s a bit more like a black ste@@
the oil spill is invented , but we have enough online content so that it becomes realistic and actually you &apos;re in the real life , and actually , if you just go to play , they &apos;ll actually get to the point where they &apos;re going to be able to do their real life , which is not what it costs , and we need to figure out , you know , video or photographs .
and wherever you look at the world , you will find that these cultures are not underway to the undersection . these are dynamic creatures that are being dendied by their existence , and this is dynamic living peoples that are being dendied by the fact through the fact that they are diving the prospects of rose trees , which are actually the very high concursance of the law water .
