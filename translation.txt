thank you .
wait twice .
robert gupta .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
that &apos;s frightening .
not yet .
i don &apos;t know .
ban is fixed .
i was amazed .
i can help .
a lot .
yeah . okay .
thank you .
invite them .
thank you .
no hospital .
that was incredible .
thank you .
you can go inside .
after a week .
i &apos;m tom .
it has sensors .
centers were built .
home ?
we love entertainment .
we love innovation .
or before bombs .
we cut off .
solar technology is ...
that &apos;s not ...
a few less .
i created one .
we were poor .
what does that mean ?
what does that mean ?
oh my god !
we are losing it .
are they all ?
sounds good ?
it &apos;s interesting .
that &apos;s us .
yeah , yes .
that &apos;s wrong .
no guilt management .
that &apos;s efficient .
completely inefficient .
don &apos;t happen .
the only chance .
yes , milliseconds .
yeah , like .
music as a language .
fantastic , right ?
yeah , hello .
the sun rises .
that &apos;s hard .
is that reasonable ?
i &apos;m a novelist .
but it goes .
thank you very much .
thank you . thank you .
an enormous challenge .
we know that .
very different term .
it &apos;s the same way .
it &apos;s awful .
very scary .
i don &apos;t know .
and he says ...
i wonder .
that was fascinating .
not very sustainable .
here it is .
it goes fast .
you need time .
that &apos;s the singing .
oh my god .
what about longevity ?
maybe 10 times as many .
from conflict , creativity .
there &apos;s no normal .
oh , so the one .
that &apos;s very good .
a few more .
players don &apos;t sit around .
it sounds stupid .
he opens the door .
why no longer live ?
so it &apos;s true .
i swear .
they &apos;re all important .
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
who are these qualities ?
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ?
people were playing crazy .
the data came in .
but you know what ?
it doesn &apos;t happen very often .
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
play isn &apos;t silly .
so they do that .
it &apos;s not a country .
because you know what ?
yeah , i know .
how do we know that ?
dk : 60,000 .
be a mentor .
what was the results ?
but you know what ?
how are they interested .
that would have been okay .
it &apos;s very risky .
it keeps your fresh .
hmmm , my brand ?
first : narrow .
i have a question .
it &apos;s finite .
let me sum up .
so how does it work ?
what &apos;s happened ?
there were codes .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
jk : both .
sounds familiar with what ?
i stood up to him .
isn &apos;t that amazing ?
thank you .
thank you very much .
in italy . yeah .
here &apos;s the video .
i dreamed of awe .
so where do we go ?
the power station could explode .
they shed them .
sounds scary .
you could see manhattan .
so they knew everything .
almost identical structure .
and i understand that .
thank you .
who &apos;s the most successful ?
isn &apos;t that sad ?
we can do it differently .
why does this happen ?
looks at something else ?
this is our present .
give chocoless a bet .
i want to tell you .
what are media media today ?
yeah , it goes .
and it has to go back .
wonderful , sir ?
all the environmental debate .
but the wrong things .
what do you say ?
they have similar principles .
we can do that .
just do your job .
this was after christmas .
what do you do ?
very expensive real estate .
they &apos;re actually hurt .
this was the result .
can we change it ?
do you curious ?
that &apos;s it .
this is the last .
good job ! yes !
so let &apos;s see .
yeah , good afternoon .
thank you for listening .
not toxic in it .
these days are over .
can i be honest ?
and i was an artist .
this is me .
what do they do ?
farm is incredible .
there &apos;s no food .
they suck .
i wanted to fund them .
what a fish .
we need energy miracle .
who will make sure ?
that &apos;s really important .
this is a wish .
bg : thank you .
let &apos;s call it him .
it &apos;s a crisis .
you see it immediately .
i can claim everything .
all of this interest me .
to be slow .
one autistic student .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
you think of it .
this is biased .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
yeah , good afternoon .
we were 20 people .
this is what i &apos;ve done .
that &apos;s the system .
so my gut sensation .
and i kept working .
he actually gathered fish .
it doesn &apos;t work that way .
a thousand , very good .
i learned everything memorized .
but i kept working .
so she was back .
and she did .
what do these people need ?
sleep deprivation is ubiquitous .
i don &apos;t think so .
what &apos;s happened ?
this is what happens to us today .
there are online criminals .
these people deserve money .
they sell certificates .
privacy must be unprecedented .
hey , why not ?
i don &apos;t know .
here &apos;s an example .
there are two ways .
i &apos;m going in here .
what does the illusion do ?
oh . a second .
okay . thank you .
so bear al .
and that &apos;s important .
they use their hands .
is it any photo ?
put them back .
it would be unbearable .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
i embody the kids .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we are constantly directing .
i thought about it .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
and why is that ?
he &apos;s called paul offit .
it was a huge success .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
and then it would realize it .
now i tried something interesting .
so what do you think ?
so what do we need to do ?
this has the highest impact .
paul is a terrorist .
the data allows us all the time .
i agree with you completely .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
shameful . shameful .
we have to spread the news .
yeah , here it is .
it was really , really profound .
what are the lessons we learned ?
but what do you feed your fish ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
they want to feed the world ?
so they saw something magic .
it &apos;s really cool . &quot;
but it didn &apos;t .
how should our forecast look like ?
it &apos;s been constant .
we first have the population .
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
next : nuclear energy .
they also include these sources of sources .
the key thing is ...
they fall the canals .
good afternoon , everybody together .
here you see the city .
these changes are happening .
so what happened after this ?
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
will it be my height ?
will i like color ?
sexual reproduction enters the picture .
some of them came and went .
you see the timing .
first extension , second .
and then everybody went down .
it loved him very much .
you can have this cloud .
let me keep us healthy .
21 to one , great .
it sounds crazy , right ?
we &apos;ve been talking of warcraft for 1994 .
there &apos;s an old study .
and here &apos;s a surprise .
they have so much uncertainty .
so the correlation is very little .
it &apos;s not true for emotions .
he had the experience .
or is it possible ?
the game is by 2007 .
i &apos;m going to end .
i want to ask you something .
i think rather than not .
how about fitness ?
he showed up the algae .
we go through negotiating rituals .
let &apos;s use it as well .
how do we work humans ?
so that sounds basically a strange thing .
this is felix .
the orange tractor .
... his own story .
so , why is it out ?
this is what you see down there .
leave that to us .
this is the marine collapse .
they didn &apos;t have books .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
we no longer produce ourselves .
it won &apos;t do it .
thorium should still work .
they really loved it .
you have to understand .
but i felt worse .
at the beginning , we only signed .
now , what does that mean ?
so , what does that mean ?
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
here &apos;s another example .
do you want jeans with holes ?
and it depends on phosphorus .
these rivers are taking a rapid cut .
why should we do that ?
and i always had it .
i find them .
why not think about that ?
not mucked .
it also is an interesting phenomenon .
the living subsids .
these are the name today .
there are four thousand people alive .
it &apos;s against justice .
it will always be more and more like that .
i can say everything .
these things are logical correctly .
it doesn &apos;t have that soul .
that &apos;s what most of you here .
he was already over 60 .
it &apos;s just not acceptable .
what would it be done ?
and here &apos;s the picture again .
and then they set up .
i only loved two loved .
that &apos;s where you can train .
it doesn &apos;t taste very well .
thankfully not , yes ?
so we &apos;re too many .
you can &apos;t have a bone .
it makes leukemia in children .
that &apos;s no protection .
that &apos;s completely trivial .
no tree is carbon neutral .
you can &apos;t store energy .
the work of interpretation .
but where are we useful ?
it was different in china .
but we need the overall one .
we say in germany sustainability .
every waste is food .
here you can see it .
so i went to the court .
once the judges saw me .
it would be fair .
we love technology and creativity .
she will touch it deeply .
it &apos;s not our problem .
we &apos;ve lost touch .
he went up and down .
what can we do ?
crisis . death . disaster .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
and a lot of people forget this .
the only country in the world .
i will never forget .
i will never forget that .
but what do we do ?
and this opens up a map .
my cousins went around .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
my brother just sat at me .
i was devastated on the ground .
i &apos;m going to suggest something .
perhaps that &apos;s the reality .
but they do the job .
this is a dead turtle .
we once started a living alive .
my name is brian desertification .
it was a helicopter .
there were still fish .
and is the limitation .
and luckily he didn &apos;t die .
it &apos;s not being documented .
you lose rare animals .
we have three main groups .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
some mutations might have some mutations .
the other one had strong diarrhea .
i actually made two mistakes .
my second mistake was worse .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
and it was .
i felt really good .
and there &apos;s good news .
he still showed up here .
asked the nurse .
her family gathered out .
and then it happened .
that made me sad .
his name is knit .
what other brands are like ?
that &apos;s a great question .
thank you for your patience .
yeah . all right .
they &apos;re very good .
we are a smaller token .
what else else is risky ?
my name is amit .
and it took 18 months .
i grew up in india .
that &apos;s a great question .
you see something fun about this .
that &apos;s the short bit .
and then something funny happened .
and that worked very well .
it feels great .
you see the water .
but it was very sad .
apparently , it was very popular .
imagine the camera .
and it was better .
but it gets worse .
is it also your mind ?
just keep . a lot of fun .
i had a good life .
maybe in our phones .
it uses these two people .
here &apos;s another example .
but it takes a lot of planning .
but there &apos;s something else .
just one trip there .
and then it became international .
did you see these guys ?
and it looks like this .
it &apos;s about something .
is it about the light ?
it has billions of those .
i lived in parallel worlds .
those two calls me .
here &apos;s the olive oil .
the answer is no .
it &apos;s supposed to be the experience .
that &apos;s what thank you .
they come from artists .
this is what the graphics looked like .
okay , a couple more .
what am i looking at ?
and jimmy roobee came .
privacy is not the debate .
it really became the dynamic .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
a billion people are starving today .
now i &apos;m watching greg lemond .
creativity had to be thrown out .
and i found it incredibly exciting .
that &apos;s why i made the film .
&quot; yes . &quot; he said .
and green was a catastrophe .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
now , 6.8 billion people live today .
if you burn coal : no .
if you burn gas , no .
and there &apos;s the storage problem .
almost never , i almost never do it .
this really solves the fuel problem .
can &apos;t be a problem .
and of course , it &apos;s incredibly powerful .
again , you have it again .
and already you have a problem .
thank you for your attention .
it keeps with flaws .
they used to say why ?
this is just an insurance method .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
that &apos;s going to happen in april april .
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
the chef had him cooking .
that &apos;s a pretty crazy idea .
so the natural things were shown .
that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
real productivity . fantastic !
everybody talks about happiness today .
what is a story of a story ?
they haven &apos;t changed the story .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
i turn my sleeve back .
this is ideology , not science .
and finally , epic importance .
they create a epic story .
so this crazy story could agree .
so we can do that .
i &apos;ll tell you the post .
and the shape plays a matter .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
and that made me feel so confused ...
the marshmallow has to be on top .
architects and engineers , for happiness .
there &apos;s also leaders .
so that &apos;s the good news .
the same thing , only bigger .
they should not suffer with other things .
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
don &apos;t take anything for granted .
the result of that was catastrophic .
because anybody here got measritors ?
and that &apos;s what he really does .
no one said that before .
it &apos;s going to go to the right thought .
let &apos;s be kogi . &quot;
it &apos;s such a natural thing .
what &apos;s happened here ?
let &apos;s do a little rate .
this is god , you know ?
this picture reminded me of something .
here he lets the sun .
now i add a bass .
anyway , not to navigate .
so the question is : how ?
it &apos;s about , you know .
this is a game for outside .
for example , this perception in the context .
does anybody know what that is ?
so it &apos;s n circle .
what takes five of 20 milliseconds ?
what is this thing ?
then i can translate the whole .
now it &apos;s just easy to have .
the answer is yes .
our magazines are read by millions .
the official dogma of what ?
these are mobile phones of the future .
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
a one has these benefits and risks .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
okay , that &apos;s really courage .
they could have better better .
so let me remind you .
everybody needs a gold glass .
we have unique elements here .
sunlight and carbon are a technique .
that &apos;s also a shift .
they went around each other .
the mechanism is from the lie .
oh , picasso says , wait .
it was just not invented .
you know what envy is ?
have you ever been suspicious ?
and how did it feel like this ?
i &apos;ll give you a little bit through the head .
it has to be the difference .
essentially a translation of translation .
my wife told me .
they &apos;re interested in fire .
he got on .
here you have this little mechanism .
we can &apos;t do that .
because it means memory .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
the byproduct is safe water .
or take a stick pen .
and that &apos;s what we take .
people about the urine .
and that &apos;s where we &apos;re too much .
hufflemissions , yes ?
we can get rid of our nutrients .
we depend on two countries .
i started an institute .
imagine mozart as well .
that &apos;s the minimum .
so it &apos;s two strands .
so not like detox .
right now , the trash is the trash .
again , who is normal ?
we didn &apos;t write this app .
how do i get away ? &quot;
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
how can we help them ? &quot;
it &apos;s growing precipitant .
and that &apos;s nothing yet .
they didn &apos;t give government .
i thought everybody could do that .
who would ever want one ?
something very strange is happening here .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
but that &apos;s not going to happen .
further than that , we don &apos;t .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
but it has an unexpected twist .
all these different generations need a few milliseconds .
it &apos;s , very simple .
it &apos;s not beyond the story .
okay , there are a few .
who do you really want to get away with this ?
we have to slow up the complexity .
well , let &apos;s go .
what &apos;s happened that day ?
so there &apos;s a feedback .
the defeat was too simple .
i &apos;ve never heard it personally .
loans and donor donors were searching .
no , never had an opportunity .
so i followed my gut feeling .
her mother moved her .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
the white lines represent population .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
in fact , we &apos;ve defined poverty .
so the growth rate is accelerating .
and that was big malos .
we think of energy scarcity .
&quot; a fighter blue dot . &quot;
you &apos;ve got one of them .
sometimes i blame myself too .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
but , you know what ?
they &apos;re an inspirational personality .
think about your own decisions .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentations .
i probably don &apos;t want to .
i got a fear of technology .
that &apos;s what it takes more and more senses .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
somehow , kids don &apos;t do it anymore .
we use the energy of the sun .
we &apos;re doing this with airplanes .
i started with my usual talk .
this is probably going to trade publicly .
it &apos;s a very sensitive question .
it &apos;s not our burden .
i talk a lot about these questions .
what are you going to do ? &quot;
third technology : spider-man .
i mean , i was going to act normal at the time .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
that &apos;s about five meters long .
and this video is real time .
the data was not available before .
the whole building was made out of water .
but the reality is increasingly worse .
you can play with different species .
here you see robert to dance .
the game starts -- silence .
the morning , before the game .
temple is fully paralyzed today .
what are you going to do with this ? &quot;
that was the beginning of the journey .
no insurance can make a loop .
we won a few awards .
they saw the big rail .
she did it for three years .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
who don &apos;t want to eat a healthier child ?
which would you like most ?
how many people would have creativity ?
is it all dedicated ?
we have a kind of a balance .
now , how could that happen ?
that &apos;s usually not the route .
they become computers in the shelters .
and that was 19 years ago .
well , i was the next .
play doesn &apos;t just play children .
and women argued that successfully .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
this is a painting of a circle .
the students are divided for grades .
and we did that .
so we measured its movement .
i &apos;m going to show you now .
i may not want to say that .
they can be logical and intuitive .
basically , they do the same thing .
this is a picture of the object .
so this is one of the images .
i see this beast .
again , jajafour .
hope , they all agree .
we are in an area .
this picture is from this place .
the one place is south korea .
these are all the metadata .
they even get funding with it .
it would have no problem at all .
and it &apos;s very risky .
totally on a particular goal .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
i &apos;m a dose of person .
that was more to the sign .
we need to think about what brands are .
he picks up the motor .
they want to orient in the museum ?
a whole bowl : chop food .
hourleght technology .
how would you describe your brand ?
i really like to clothing with nice clothing .
tell me about this world .
and she picks up 257 .
they were genetically engineered .
it was my first sunfire .
the stones are color .
lego made it possible for everyone .
and that argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
don &apos;t have to worry .
they tap their internet connection .
the company headquarters are right there .
people were still happy .
she was back and dying .
they grow by five centimeters .
the emergency staff took all the strands .
i &apos;m the redefined doctor .
it divides her experiences to others .
and it starts with a doctor .
all of this is inevitable .
i don &apos;t take the same course .
but there are two problems .
i started feeling better .
but surely , it took it .
and it was an incredible experience .
the assumption of perhaps two percent .
i forced myself from this fish .
simple , it &apos;s going to come .
so i just started playing .
music is medicine . music change us .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
how far do you get there ?
we also have very detailed data .
it kind of disturbed us .
they reverse the flow of the water .
they literally threw the dials .
i &apos;m an expert on relationships . &quot;
what &apos;s the valuation ? &quot;
and then we said , okay .
he shook his head , no .
no , no , no , it can &apos;t .
and then he can run away .
tell that what you &apos;re feeling .
and this sounds very different from it .
so the first step to an interpretation .
meanwhile , the instruments have progressed .
behind the seven mountains , and so on .
this is a huge network .
it &apos;s like a box box .
i came up with him especially .
and here you are .
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
yes , these are the data .
open ? i was totally confused .
and yet there &apos;s no interpretation of it .
my grandparents kept this number up to 70 .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
and even lomborst thinks .
they don &apos;t invest time in power .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and it can make a huge difference .
and everybody in this room has to go in .
anyway , we need a solution .
what &apos;s the case i am doing ?
we have commitment . pop .
not even the truth will make it free .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it doesn &apos;t do anything to science .
it &apos;s kind of like a potato .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
so every concert is another concert .
so this was a very strange experience .
they live with the help of chemosynthesis .
do that for kids ? &quot;
how will they feed the world ? &quot;
you can go inside a particular year .
i &apos;m listening to that , thank you .
i was able to draw . i could paint .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
there &apos;s a lot of things that has to come together .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
and for energy , this is what i felt .
so here are some natural fireflies .
so this is a tough nrage .
it should have these two elements .
it &apos;s like learning .
a language is the expression of the human mind .
have a nice fit to this .
so , this was my primary motivation .
and the list you can continue on endlessly .
seriously -- the doom .
go and qustaze cohen .
the permanent ice is labeled with red .
fantastic ! this machine is quite loud .
i &apos;m going to start with some simple examples .
and this picture was recorded by atlas .
this is the machine underneath the honey .
more than these other two networks .
so , it was a pretty fancy project .
and this is all in the beginning .
i &apos;d like to really acknowledge that .
no , no , no , far .
so we indutioned about 50 of the magnet .
the question is , what &apos;s next ?
these are all different questions .
and there are several reasons for this .
you can &apos;t do anything .
they &apos;re the home countries of someone .
156 countries , our television channel .
now let &apos;s take something else .
this is my supermarket . there &apos;s no big .
you may have to see a look at this .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
well , this cartoon is a couple of the statements .
three : esxone of the expectations .
the truth is more like this .
so we started this 15 years ago .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
the book and on the image .
the grandfather made this young man refused .
for example , the louch , yes ?
all of it is comterable .
so to ask , what is the right ?
in the way we think of north .
there &apos;s everybody &apos;s footprint .
so saving , avoid , avoid , avoid .
you can show , i was there .
so you can &apos;t do that .
so , men don &apos;t have pigs .
that &apos;s just what &apos;s been shown .
technical sheets is the same .
if you come to this , right ?
we can reinvent anything again .
the key reasons to write it .
but it &apos;s completely effective , right ?
how did he relate ?
does anybody know what is three seconds ?
it &apos;s got to process as a present .
they often forget again in the third time .
you see from the back to the front .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s measurable .
a daltintiner , right .
i see the dalglasses .
that the theme of ecology is a global .
and all of this is manipulor content .
and what does that mean for designers ?
that &apos;s what we call a philosophical model .
you &apos;ve got a cake .
and curiosity cannot learn .
it &apos;s just a little bit less devastation .
because we don &apos;t want to go around genes ?
we worked late at night .
her father died in short after her birth .
he moved back to silence .
he died , broken through history .
all the adults were aware of risk .
a little freaked up in me .
we had no cents for a year .
who would have happened all of this ?
someone made an elderly version of it .
and still a realistic level .
the shore comes from another place .
and i wake up every morning .
today , i &apos;m going to tell me about unexpected discoveries .
i work in solar engineering .
nobody has to give your ideas green .
oh , my time is already over ?
now we saw the inverzed effect .
and i want to read to you .
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
now , that &apos;s not right .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
it &apos;s getting a thousand kilometers .
here &apos;s her marmelwick .
this is a modest little app .
even cats look at this video .
my fourth technique : the premise of complexity .
motors , motors -- four possibilities .
oh my god . oh my god .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
he had lots of natural videos .
... it &apos;s making attention to it .
but they really want to go deep .
well , i went to the court hall .
that i had written these crazy things .
i think our identity is threatened .
do you want to come and listen ? &quot;
we want to do something about a death penalty company .
i &apos;m tired of all of us .
and then he whispered to the ear .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
we don &apos;t really know a lot about it .
i think there are opportunities .
but maybe that &apos;s not the case .
child mortality has risen by a tenth .
we live in a truly extraordinary time .
and we &apos;re going to increase our aspiration .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflict .
you go around and collaborative .
it can know where we are .
these are the apgoas .
and that worked . applause for scott .
good night , sweet marb . &quot;
and these are the neural structures .
i was trying to understand it .
at 16 , i started drawing books .
so scott comes up with this .
i prefer people in death cells .
i learned this from my grandmother .
she was the daughter of a slave family .
the silence is risky .
many of my clients are very young .
we &apos;ve already run a lot of work .
and i &apos;ve never seen it .
so , look what happens .
thank you , but the best is still coming .
i remember my first fire .
and you know what i &apos;ve learned ?
they divided the kingdom into two .
we can give ourselves something to ourselves .
do you want to become more attractive and confident ?
but what will happen in the future ?
these are going to be untestable .
people were suffering . people were fighting .
five million people use it every month .
but the game is a shape-transducer .
both of these are survival , both of the light .
it turns out it &apos;s really hard .
do we really want to go into that direction ?
we don &apos;t exist in this kind of species .
but it doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
i call it the shining tiger .
we get an absolutely flat line .
thank you , danny kahneman .
i hold the knife in my hand .
the radiation is a role .
everybody would like to make people happier .
and it &apos;s a very simple question .
daniel kahneu : sure .
monday : color is a little force .
so we &apos;ve got 125 billion players .
no , i mean it really seriously .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
so the first line is a moment .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
and the goal is very simple .
so ... so , not so optimistic .
what usually would they describe to you .
this is a child &apos;s game , right ?
that made no sense in my eyes .
okay , you want to know that ?
i went to prison -- hard .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
and i had to go out of town .
it all comes from our own pockets .
we &apos;re talking about bold fresh .
and this is a million company .
they brought their pictures , you know ?
i like things that are different .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with artists directly .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the film hasn &apos;t got it yet .
it came out four and a half years ago in italy .
and in italy , in italy , it won &apos;t end up in italy .
just be just who you are .
wednesday : take your inner child .
thursday morning : self-confidence is the key .
it &apos;s called &quot; connecting with me . &quot;
let &apos;s start with it .
tuesday : customization will be completely overwhelmed .
thank you so much , that was incredible .
the roof was also covered with water .
you can do that all the time .
but the truth is far away .
and that was the genesis of it .
he can use his eyes .
now look at this curve .
bjsin sundin .
and his response was &quot; yes . &quot;
it can give you a order of change .
no one seems like the rain .
this is alfred gonzi .
she wasn &apos;t finished yet .
i thought i could integrate it .
what do you do with binary ?
but western governments are helping themselves .
but today we &apos;re far beyond it .
the difference becomes that as loss .
notice two things about this curve .
but i &apos;ll ask you a question .
maybe i did it with the reason .
because we live on a water planet .
what are these three billion people going to bring ?
so far , this was a problem for supercomputer .
&quot; jeopardy , &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about transformative standards .
they came up with their blood pressure .
why went to medicine ?
alone , fools and no assistance .
so bandura &apos;s open is open source .
so basically , my two affses .
so , that blew me up .
instead , let &apos;s look at the green model .
you can jump directly to a specific scale .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; drowning into information . &quot;
i was completely science , you know .
but i was not going to unpose .
you can fly 240 kilometers every morning .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
i was quite obsessed with studying the deep sea .
we went back to the train of the titanic .
so what can we close from all of this ?
isn &apos;t that half or a quarter ? &quot;
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
and every night , they fly 240 kilometers .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
the logic is not about the reality .
you say , there &apos;s no census .
a phrase with his own breath .
especially beautiful story , i mean .
because now you can apply a three-piece .
three is you know from school .
in this three-point come three sentences .
i &apos;ve summarized the last three of the five .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
we &apos;ve got 20 percent in germany .
these were the very first calculation of six years ago .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
for nathaniel , music is seelimental health .
i said , &quot; chicken hot pellets ? &quot;
the internet and the services is a miracle .
his personal voices of seacles .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
well , i &apos;ll show you .
and some of it works , and some of it &apos;s not .
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand that .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent lives .
we don &apos;t want companies to own seed .
it &apos;s right , morality , patent stuff .
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
we now have measrids in this country now .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
usually i would take the needle out .
there &apos;s a lot of good coaching .
he had his fun music for 20 minutes .
now , would you have the same vacation ?
they have them . they always have them .
it &apos;s kind of a barendment .
you can predict the predictions . why is this ?
they &apos;re leading the process , they understand it .
that &apos;s going to be a key element of this building .
there &apos;s a lot of great books on this topic .
we need to use more research for more research .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
the guy in the middle isn &apos;t that much .
what happened to it happened to these design students ?
we followed that exercise with the same students .
there &apos;d never been a time like this .
do anybody even know what that is ?
we talk about that .
most of all , when he died .
now this level of intuition becomes very important .
that &apos;s a disruptive part .
the water sheets have been expanding .
but we &apos;re starting to see a change .
it just wasn &apos;t going to be , you know ?
oh , jesus , what kind of thought !
if not , everyone else is somebody else .
his whole working process has changed itself .
this is a year of water river .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
we have thousands of organisms that we can do .
this is one , part of her .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
it &apos;s about a new delivery of america .
we need to get far , pretty quickly .
and these interactive portraits come in each other .
it &apos;s going to be a challenge for nine .
this is an interactive factory kit .
here &apos;s a pair on the hamptons .
i could park right before my house . &quot;
yeah . it does not discover anything else .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
in other domains -- the world of communication .
we don &apos;t inherit identity ; we invent them .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
i &apos;m very excited to be there .
they laughed more than you do here .
i &apos;m wearing my jeans , almost all the time .
they &apos;re concerned about that .
they increase the paralysis and you lose happiness .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask an amazing question .
it &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
and you &apos;re also feeling your movements and the mood .
many of you are surrounded by your faces .
and we see that it can do it .
but the phosphorus is not able to replace it .
because that &apos;s what it shows , right ?
there is no overplanetary problem in trees .
we can support them good .
we can support them good .
that is , we need to get phosphorus back .
ratz the environment , make less trash .
the phosphorus issue is much more critical .
it &apos;s not a resource efficiency , but efficiency .
if you fall in love , efficient ?
but with the right design , please .
in two hours , they &apos;re running around .
of course , it &apos;s not all compositional able .
this is balanced in china in a second .
all these wind vessels are everywhere , almost .
every society is shaped by an international medium .
at the beginning , tribal society is through the language .
now , if you think a little bit further .
but that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to talk about .
what left us is the limitation .
i want to explain a little bit a little bit .
so from modern into the computer company .
and that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing .
and there &apos;s a central point to this .
just to say , what is information ?
now you see the dalglasses .
and further , now you can always see it .
so it &apos;s more likely to say the norm .
i &apos;m going to try this up by an example .
thank you . i have a question for you .
she &apos;s got a button , at an b .
next week , it comes to the market .
i didn &apos;t know the etiquette .
life hasn &apos;t changed for centuries .
&quot; they didn &apos;t let them . &quot;
the underwater part comes from a quarry .
and here &apos;s every piece very well planned .
my mother suffered from the boat &apos;s dreams .
well , it was friday on friday .
it might take you until it &apos;s charged .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
there &apos;s a lot of people who received the government .
boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center .
scott underheld human to human .
but that &apos;s how many got over the years .
and we use this word with these plastic .
there &apos;s another aspect of the story .
i got him here on my laptop . &quot;
emd : &quot; name transparency &quot;
but i &apos;m going to focus on the show .
very easily , you can zoom in and zoom out .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
... can you just show the slide .
in fact , no medical video wanted not to do a viric video .
well , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
because it doesn &apos;t really feel the money .
here are two different bags .
whooo , eco-wwkw !
in 2010 , it had been 23 million times .
that our contribution to the system is to choose .
we should put the bear in the cage .
this is moore &apos;s law last hundred years .
it &apos;s slowed down for none of the big problems .
it seems to me to unite both .
i said , &quot; i &apos;ll listen . &quot;
we want to eliminate mass fighters . &quot;
i learned a couple of simple things .
he came up to me and hugging me .
the death penalty question is an interesting question .
there are some highly interesting things .
thirty years ago , this would have been ridiculed .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and oxygen .
i call them &quot; the origin billion . &quot;
we &apos;ve just seen 70 billion ares .
we have the passion of a digian innovators .
in america , the death penalty is defined by mistakes .
the first is a classic , apple .
it can know how we think it is .
this is a really inspiring honor for me .
the next step now happened within these communities .
say , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
it &apos;s ververl and weird programs .
we &apos;re in the middle of this transition point .
and they were allowed to be inspired .
so every drip was a little different .
we seem to be quite pleased to be satisfied .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
i said , &quot; i promise you . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandma . &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
this country is different than 40 years ago .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
or are they more like a backwards ?
but bonobos show us the other side of the automobile .
look at what she does .
it &apos;s just the test of survival and success .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
the main man tied me .
ladies and gentlemen , their kin .
i was trying to preserve the body .
come , dance with me . thank you .
so two pairs of pairs , each one is a baby .
we later come back to these people .
intersexuality comes in many different forms .
so a lot of testosterone , but there &apos;s no reaction to that .
they are in the back of our body .
i wanted to recover the health for a disease .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
8,000 players played the game 8 weeks .
and there &apos;s tons of staff .
i don &apos;t get that feedback in real life .
that &apos;s the truth . i think it &apos;s .
players are masters in the modern world social nets .
but it &apos;s definitely not an opstry .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
and then , of course , done .
what do you think happens next ?
unfortunately , she doesn &apos;t do much better .
but it &apos;s not just about words .
and i would argue that &apos;s good .
wiwieries are just to live in our lives .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
this is one of the classic words of play .
because otherwise our problem would be even greater .
by the way , this is just the work .
make it possible -- you all here .
imagine an airplane full of smoke .
i never want to do anything more about life .
so this made sense . it fit together .
so again , this really carefully fit together .
normal people are not available these tools . &quot;
every iceberg has its own individual personality .
no , that was what i thought .
i want to help you calm .
these things have a more positive effect .
you should tell me about my brand .
tell me a little bit about this part .
this is something like our fight .
electronics electronics ! no , thank you !
let me tell you a little bit about this .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you read people because of their character ?
so i think we need to be educated .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
and i &apos;m going to summarize that for you .
they had a concept of blue blood .
as an artist , i &apos;m very important to me .
so this is the reason for this project .
here you can see the building works .
i want to show you here .
so they can feel the whole movement .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
we have the capital of techno-philanthrotellers .
it supports other people &apos;s mistakes .
it &apos;s a totally non-denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and safety .
they &apos;re getting fewer because we start them .
so you don &apos;t mean any more biased animals .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
if you generalize it , what happens is that .
we still think they &apos;re originally originally .
i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes .
it &apos;s the average performance of man .
what you need is a new medical culture .
i was an imobsous student .
that &apos;s the system that we live in .
one thing i thought was the kidney stones .
it was much go , and i got in a hurry .
but i continued to ask these questions .
and that &apos;s what i felt .
this is the kind of wiki shame .
three words glated : do you remember ?
and feedback to my upper doctor .
so they can &apos;t make them wrong .
here he picks up a rare taddle .
now , he mentioned the mineral needs of phytoplankton .
so smart grid , a huge issue everywhere .
and that &apos;s like &apos; n the message .
and in the time , you can respond to another another .
it &apos;s hard to overrate destruction .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put on .
is it great , then we have a business model .
and then a whole bunch of simulation .
&quot; look at her hair , pink .
the flandergo eat the shrimp .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
i &apos;m going to give you the end of the government .
natural light offers spider grid grid .
as a child , i drew comic books and stuff like this .
this is the hardest part of my talk .
the first two sentences , they are logical .
it &apos;s just just her , and it &apos;s not herself .
because artists have a strong relationship to a lie .
because we cannot live without this kind of life .
so , we can &apos;t touch these things .
so it &apos;s going to come from the outside to people .
and so i got a slightly unusual decision .
no one has done no one in the world .
the logic doesn &apos;t make an argument about what &apos;s happening .
we can lead these things to multiple examples .
and yeah , i go again again .
and then it looks like this .
our goal was to say , okay .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
it &apos;s not just a nice sound paper .
we had no children in this country yesterday .
do you all put your vitamine tomorrow ?
what happened is we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
and they &apos;re not only dying of sanitation .
but you know what you &apos;re not right at ?
diphlet , aams , child paralysis ...
why are we doing this ? why are we doing this ?
we &apos;re walking into the arms of the placebo .
and i have all kinds of props here .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
there was no canental melars .
they were just like the people in this room .
he lived only nine years of living .
the gears for hundreds of millions of years .
many talk from a 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
there &apos;s an attachment , which is mutual respect .
i think at first , the curiosity is curiosity .
today i &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate .
so , going to change change is going to be awful for you .
this needs to be down here , zero down .
the movies don &apos;t give us any money .
my parents are the 80 to the heel .
because they have special skills of the process .
now they understood the benefit of the creation .
it feeds the highest construction in the world .
do we have a machine here .
my grandparents were all when they were 60 .
now , can you play it in blue ?
you just hear it , and start talking .
on interpretation , it &apos;s barely spoken to speech .
everybody knew their genius was something delicious .
it would roll over the country .
the immense refues in the control room .
and they had to remove what we did .
they &apos;re all back on your way .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all of these things .
like algae -- and other terrifying things .
it &apos;s got a molecular weight of over 300 million .
these are footage about six seconds .
not only bad , but the worst of all times .
and that &apos;s great , because we need it .
when your job is to dance , dance .
and if it &apos;s not , dance on your dance .
it grows in the winter and its shrinking in summer .
this is an organism that we wrote in 1996 .
this is a completely unfair development pattern .
and we can navigate in this very simple way .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception here .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
and the problem is not the technology .
but these are all the streets in the united states
there are those who are a lot of spatial .
we had to do ourselves because of the lawyers .
support america . find more .
some people were disappointed that there was no poetry .
to maximize freedom is a choice to maximize .
and it &apos;s also rooted in our lives .
but here is what they should have thought .
everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is gone .
your problem is they have too little .
but the volume is much bigger than ever before .
54 percent of the deaths have happened through publishing .
of course , we can see the garbage problem .
a baby takes about six thousand diapers .
information is every difference that &apos;s a difference .
now everyone &apos;s trying to see something like this .
how can i make some sort of insuluuable possible ?
and less burning or user friendly is it .
ratz the environment , make less energy .
a researcher for natural user interface design .
and we might just like to look at this .
but today we &apos;re only talking about the biological systems .
no , we fixed what &apos;s inside .
but everything that &apos;s inside is useful .
so , help me a little bit .
do you remember the taf again ?
we &apos;ve understood that the weather is global .
and i said , in my youth , i said .
yeah , so what is biohacking ?
now , what are the funaonic model ?
if you want to come up , go together . &quot;
now he takes a tractor into the scene .
now , i &apos;m going to do a little bit more quick stuff .
i can put the sequence in it .
i look forward to all of you .
new investment to create well-paid jobs .
anyway , you &apos;re doing that in there .
or they didn &apos;t have any photolitotography .
and in this mind , the memory was going on .
from jewish age to the machine age .
another example is called a virtual reality .
and the two of them are here today .
we &apos;ve gotten off , which didn &apos;t work .
you come down to two things -- very simple .
here we were , and this is the painting .
what other tricks are they going through ?
there were a lot of crazy things going on .
or are they more like a slow meeting ?
and that &apos;s what these brands did .
it &apos;s not yet gone to other countries .
lawyer : i &apos;m an antary mark .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
but the best part is still -- in a second .
another favorite image of me , star night .
now , i &apos;m going to show you my favorite feature .
and this was an experience in humility for me .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a fold .
it &apos;s the way i want to be .
the rest of the time is they &apos;re boxalized .
you know how many people watching this tedtalks ?
it was &quot; in &apos; 7 , forever . &quot;
these results have been working by several weeks .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more aggressive .
so at this point , we need digital security systems .
and what i &apos;m saying is very important .
you just have to distribute it as far as possible .
the people of the audience were very serious and attention .
man 3 : i &apos;m the beonic guy .
what do you think the answer is ?
the answer is very likely to be no .
no one didn &apos;t want to do something with the movie .
no , that wasn &apos;t the mistake at all .
all right , what is the brand gerry ?
it &apos;s just too precise for more precise points .
so we start with a windows carpper .
we all have charted systems in our cars .
and sure enough , we can find fast food chains .
and let me show you a simple example .
and i see the same process in scanning the photographs .
i always start with a kind , an idea .
that &apos;s the combination of different images .
i put my job at 95 lbs .
is it about the details or the color ?
my mother asked us to express their hand .
we &apos;ve been asking , and no one knew it .
and we designed an iber app .
and we want to bring this to a global level .
al is a fire hydrant in the city .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the redwood rats .
so i think calculus are very simple .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s done .
my grandmother never forgot my life .
so , the theme of the day : financial cost .
a typical wal-mart spends for you today , 100,000 dollars .
i think i &apos;ve probably heard more hands .
it was almost 200 million times this year .
this year , it became almost 50 million times .
also , new designers and designers are very interested .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
no apple ever tasted it again .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
there must be another piece of piece .
&quot; don &apos;t &quot; be untrue .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines of code .
we negotiated food .
and that &apos;s the planning line behind my loxnet .
edward cafuova is a bat scientist .
i just agree , that &apos;s logical .
this player is just about a epic victory .
that &apos;s a problem that a lot of the players have .
this constant feedback is not life in real life .
you expect a extra billion players in the next decade .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
there seems to be an unfulfilling .
what we want is to create the future .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open up doors ?
maybe we can see more powerful as change .
it was summer , and i was static .
so again , what the potential we want to do now ?
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s a dominant thing .
raise your hands . let me see .
what ? that really made me freak out .
i &apos;m really sorry . does you get that crazy ?
you know science is not a company .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
and why ? well , reengineer foods .
you wouldn &apos;t be starving , and you know what ?
there &apos;s somebody who &apos;s not a childhood .
how many would you have to choose for good memory ?
and you ask , what happens to those moments ?
the people in the subway room come in .
let me show you a little bit .
i mean , this is a real cognitive case .
well , remember itself is a storyteller .
and let me start with an example .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
yeah , they &apos;re right . fix that .
that &apos;s how they communicate -- they walk along your fingers .
so i was interviewing a few months later at a conference .
second half-time . end of normal time time .
beau guesses , in a moment of head .
well , we introduced the mayor of the mayor .
that &apos;s something that &apos;s built in the city .
on the left , you see a little boat .
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
you &apos;re not talking about god and nature .
but there was always a life cycle in your presentation .
and we need to improve a lot about this device .
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
it was something we knew .
imagine a sound accident .
france makes a gateway . italy is a gateway .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the bed staff .
so they go on ; save your shoes .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees our nearest living relatives .
i want to do it by not going to die . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily want to be the longest .
and this is indeed a conservative estimate .
as i said , amanda &apos;s got our charter .
the dog ! i was useless .
we &apos;ve been here for about 130,000 years ago .
they moved to a natural concept .
and we learn trust , and the rules of the game .
in other words , game is our adaptgraphic .
just think of this for a moment .
so we have this terrible simplistic idea .
and it &apos;s not just in terms of gender .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and this is very important in medical science .
what are they going to consume ? what are you going to use ?
you know how to call a 40000ter ?
all right , really good , maybe a single star .
we have access to an exponential technology .
i put them and made it for the treatment .
it &apos;s a game called mathematicians called it .
and i went back to work .
and we &apos;ve also seen this in mobile phones .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for that .
different speakers : drug war . weapons . temperatures .
and it wasn &apos;t a very difficult diagnosis .
there &apos;s a chance to do something .
i remember being yesterday .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not a big loss .
and yet , we &apos;re still on the galapagos .
let me show you how they work .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
the question is , why people accept this .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a break .
that &apos;s what our goal is now .
it hardly barely ached and was left with blue .
he described one of them as a &quot; usually . &quot;
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
she had not suffered a light-able brain damage .
what would you tell someone that believes ?
marb ? yeah . alive ? yaging .
it could take place within a goal of time .
the disnotation of the dna was an interesting step .
now we &apos;re going to do it with math and machines .
so , there &apos;s the technology out of the technology .
and try to do this again with another generation .
fireflies , in a glass , i found very exciting .
and the cell communities started to abstract information .
it also shows in other places of the book .
all of those who were , they began to split .
the transition is happening . we can all feel it .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
and i &apos;m going to get a character in the book .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
and the light path through the rest of the book .
and i went over and i just listened to it .
assets , not debt , it affects the outcome .
and then i ask myself : how could that happen ?
in my work , i learned very simple things .
we want to reduce the number of death deaths .
and i have to say , there was power .
an amazing error margin . one of nine innocent .
in one place , the screen is filled with sheets .
my uncle died of alcohol in alcohol .
first of all , i thought that was a game .
she had the last word in every family argument .
and we want to make this material available for everyone .
they &apos;ve got 15 percent of the age of 15 percent .
and the question is , why didn &apos;t you anymore ?
the soul is kind of a mental response , say about leibniz .
so this is the idea of how the soul works .
so if horklings says , there is no soul .
because , in fact , this person is not interested in understanding .
and in berlin , there was a crazy engineering collective .
there &apos;s only the second best for the fire brigade .
so do that , and then you learn the sentence .
the conventional system looks like this .
now , fortunately , there &apos;s a lot of studies now .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s violin concert .
and he &apos;s going to fire his grutic states .
bruno giussani : thank you . thank you .
we actually know that something else is the case .
he &apos;s got a feed of 15 to one .
in fact , the scores are very delicate and unaccurate .
i can &apos;t play today in 20 years today .
then i say heart suffering , yes ?
because you know , it &apos;s a soft process .
hey , puma , are you really serious ?
now , that &apos;s because they &apos;ve got twice the board .
in the countries where people get to money .
&quot; 94 to one thing ? what do you name ? &quot;
why would i afford to make a little car ?
so there he was , and he said , &quot; like that ?
because the notes are the only connection to him .
the musical instrument is the extension of our body .
but maybe you can also change them .
and then this was the very first start of a own musical expression .
i had a relationship with this beauty over several months .
we &apos;ve been used now over the course of three years .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
where is the biggest interest to get this really ?
in fact , the progression society is coming back .
probably one of those numbers must get very close to zero .
the second factor is the amount of money we use .
in each one of these five areas we need to do at least 100 people .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t give you yourself .
why do i do this ? what is that ? &quot;
this is one of the things that &apos;s been made .
bg : a energy breakthrough is the most important thing .
those who are doing scientific arguments are very little .
the main problem here is similar to aids .
so for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and also , the energy soisto for them is very important .
that is , the ants weigh many more than us .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
but for many people , it &apos;s a little bit radical .
he &apos;s a biologist at a j.a la palma .
i mean , they haven &apos;t seen something like this .
so the steven plan , the better the system . &quot;
catch a fish , but also a birdreserve .
he said , &quot; the skin acts like a sponge .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can do it .
and i persuaded them to fund an expedition .
this is not a industry , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
they can be immersed in a decade .
you do something a little bit differently .
we &apos;re talking about the fall of the information flow .
i grew up with a spin of science fiction .
no , that &apos;s the right thing , right ?
and of course we all share the same remix necessary .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
we take images of these mini 2,000 people in detectors .
we built it . we repaired it .
our steps to fast-forward was exponentially .
as it turns out , dna synthetic adaptation is very difficult .
you may have heard that we have watermarks .
we tried to get to the point of automation .
so we &apos;re now focusing on raw generation .
second , what economists call opperypc cost .
and the world that we lived looked like .
by the end of march , the lhc will be able to restore again .
it &apos;s also my big , lifelong love and fascination .
i may have another 40 years of mine .
and everybody knew that it worked , right ?
and all of a sudden , he was no longer breathing .
but it &apos;s not always a bad thing .
this is 20 feet of sea level , like greenland .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the weird things .
if you want to create it , they produce hyperlinks between the images .
the race is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
it &apos;s our new country , and it &apos;s called 1,500 .
every big picture is the beginning of a tear .
or other models , or even technical specics .
gorillas is a political debate in our country .
and we &apos;re so excited as we want to .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . thank you .
the official belief from all the western industrialized societies .
i just want to say a little bit about salc .
you have to admit that this is a huge selection .
you know what the answer to this question is ?
and breol√© ! line for yourself at all .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re going to bring children to the world .
that &apos;s where it &apos;s going to be more like mine .
i don &apos;t know who you know of this picture .
this is a game , i have to say .
i &apos;m also going to clear what &apos;s inside there .
it &apos;s just the way it happened in the village .
and what &apos;s it happening in there ?
so how do we work when we look inside there ?
what happens is that this is the equivalent of the brain .
the only thing they had was their head .
that &apos;s the period where you fall in love .
and six and a couple of milliseconds , even a fascinating phenomenon .
so how does human beings deal with certain things .
if we actually don &apos;t take any phosphorus and make it .
over 60 percent of the carbon is stored .
we &apos;ve been used to that things happen .
the first question is , are we really too much ?
here &apos;s a couple of people who test it .
so for him , they were just construction .
frosty , the coal man gets clean every day .
this is the source of most of the coal in west virginia .
so don &apos;t worry about climate change .
the coal coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean carbon technology .
they &apos;ve seen it warm in the news .
it is virtual reality , and it &apos;s all without computers .
we wanted to develop a tool for language learning .
that &apos;s not really a joke , but it &apos;s not supposed to be a joke .
well , what do we do now ?
that &apos;s a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
how many doors have the house in which they live ?
1m is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
these are the people who form my worldview .
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this strange landstreet .
so what are we going to see in the movie ?
are you far ? you see a little bit nervous .
and then we give one of these great fat heels .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like all of us .
they absolutely wanted nothing to do with the project .
how much money is required to realize that ?
next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
a little bit more about you , that you &apos;re not .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with it .
and how was it going to be successful ?
this is just online -- no press , no tv .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
so you &apos;re just going to be able to click .
i want to tell you how we found this .
it &apos;s natasha , and it &apos;s just ironic .
he says , &quot; yield . &quot;
i learned that in a moment everything is different .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
and in the world , everything has a sense of me .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
you can look around all these museums here .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
think about it . this attack is generic .
that &apos;s the consequence that we have to confront .
so the driving force is the ib-c .
i &apos;ve been working on a coal-mines -- dangerous .
i &apos;ve been filming in war fields -- difficult and dangerous .
it doesn &apos;t even exist online . no .
today i want to talk to you about circles and jargon .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
it was completely left that they could fail .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
and this video was actually funded in january .
but that day , this particular friday ?
and all of this is going to give us a big question ...
i want to tell you about some of the puzzle pieces .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
all right , let me show you a little bit more .
and after three months in a refugee camp , we flew in melbourne .
i didn &apos;t know how to use this before .
i said to my mom , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
i met the decision to pull into the u.s. .
if i say reality , i mean i &apos;m recording reality .
because the pictures took it to real sense .
there &apos;s all of these chairs in the great enlightenment .
look , let me give you an analogy .
we found that it &apos;s really very strange .
you put in a zoard . you can really go in there .
this is star night , never seen this before .
this is the really cool part , called the operators .
i think they don &apos;t even come out of the museums .
but my logical logical hand didn &apos;t like it .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
they had 348 different types of marxade .
now , what i &apos;m telling you about is what really fantastic .
there &apos;s more behind it . it &apos;s even deeper .
right now , we &apos;re far away from that goal .
in this airport , there &apos;s a 100 square kilometers across this airport .
that &apos;s an idea worth spreading .
the pilot drove the machine after the hudson river .
and i thought , let &apos;s bring it out .
since that time we &apos;ve all given all sorts of recognition .
the biggest difference between you is the ability of time .
that doesn &apos;t work at all for remembering itself .
but now you can &apos;t count my finger , right ?
what it ruins was the memories of the experience .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
but one of them is clearly worse than the other .
well , living itself is confined to life .
probably many of you in the room probably know this trick .
i &apos;m just going to hold the knife in my hands .
the living self has no voice in that choice .
it &apos;s not about how happy a person lives .
well , their lifestyle itself is going to be happier .
i mean , i have rarely seen that flat lines .
the more money you buy is you do it .
... that &apos;s the one that &apos;s going to play a role .
and it &apos;s an economist . so he &apos;s logical .
that &apos;s great . i love the placebo of placebo .
this is an outrageous debate . it needs to stop .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and i took it for a while to figure out .
this is authoritarian and we should be ashamed .
so we &apos;re going away from the way , and where do we go ?
in the same way , i think we &apos;re going to play today .
and i &apos;ll explain why i tell him why .
we &apos;ve done it in the last 11,000 years .
you need it , and we don &apos;t need them .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s mies .
anyway . i definitely want to do that in any case .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain it .
so that &apos;s the problem that i &apos;ve been trying to solve .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
obviously , this isn &apos;t going to fit all of my little suitcase .
but are we going to drive the best out of our game drive ?
and this is called the mystery receptor defect .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
we see that in all sorts of different areas of human life .
we see the same thing in the disabled movement .
well , chimpanzees are known for their alirality .
he &apos;s eating every five-le hope from my consciousness .
i &apos;ve got something i want to show you .
it was in italy , the footworld contest .
here are the results we &apos;ve just got .
we called it the digital water .
and it &apos;s very rare to actually witness a wheelch iceberg .
but unfortunately , bonobos are the least known known among primates .
so they move around and make art works like this .
and it was like three months .
how about good health to good health ?
this is an amazing adventure that you go on .
so i &apos;m saying , let &apos;s start the world games .
here &apos;s the latest version version of this building .
you see , dr. kean has changed .
they bring them to their own tracks .
we don &apos;t want to try to tell the future before .
so at berkeley bionics , we call these robots more exotic .
this is another view of the tree of life .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to move forward .
how could it be possible that we do this ?
now , imagine two other little changes .
but at the same time , we know that it &apos;s not possible .
he invited the king of sian to dinner .
and that &apos;s why the dramatic numbers come in the prison inmates .
it &apos;s developed at the university of washington in seattle .
there &apos;s a program that might recognize some of you .
he took a famous photograph . how was it it ?
and then let &apos;s put this analogy into the future .
and i spent more and more knowledge .
thank you for ted . thank you .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the leader of the vote .
it was the misguided crus-witness vessel .
this deputy ran across to the older black black .
i got into the car , and i was overwhelmed .
right , bryan , the judge has magical powers .
and this game was done by university professors and so on .
wlet want to help people who have been innocent .
i looked a rare mcprinter and she was breathing .
someone had broken up and had the system thoroughly editing .
in our own countries , we would never do something like this .
it was called the &quot; cleaning rock . &quot;
but , you know , if you go into a foreign
irinotar is a certified place .
now , how do people die in a row like this ?
it was always so inspiring .
in the future most of the crime will go online .
they closed them on the profile machine .
the brows describe it as pristine .
now he stands on the red list .
you know , he was in 1835 .
i was shocked by the inner seils .
even who kills him is not just a killer .
it &apos;s really about combining different realities .
that &apos;s great . that &apos;s where the digital is the physical .
he type &quot; figub &quot; into the official database .
and this was the brain , and the nervous system of communities .
so the stepypycal movement has done it .
we need to bring ourselves to the virtue of government .
because this is where the real government work is going .
wait that one , smell the rest .
but what happened to &quot; the killing &quot; is different .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibility yet .
this is the call center for service and information .
so he got the citizens to test it .
the next step was to find the apps for this .
we know one where all the oil stations are .
so today , evolution has happened throughout the span of microseconds .
now , you can combine something like this .
and finally , i get programs that can be very common .
my grandfather was in prison in prison .
i remember it was yesterday .
these women were just meeting and they just sat .
and yet , there is this mental disconnection .
he said , &quot; in germany , there is no death penalty .
i &apos;ve thought of some of the talks in germany across the death penalty .
and i said , &quot; yeah , really . &quot;
we really kind of silly around it .
the child in me is really excited about that .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
it was also the origin of a lot of conflict in our family .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
you can say things about the world in the world .
we also brought to design and also brought into design schools .
you heard from a farm who doesn &apos;t belong to the animals ?
it &apos;s this vorting taste .
so i &apos;ve covered a lot of fish in my life .
so you could be comfortable with selling him .
i used it in a restaurant in southern spain .
a friend of mine had been talking about this fish for a long time .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
we have 30 gigawatts of solar photovoltaics in germany .
then we have to break our mup-train policy on the network .
i mentioned this to miguel , and he &apos;s laughing .
because they are the ones who are experts for taste .
and i &apos;m going to see another pattern that makes it .
you might like to test it for my talk in their classrooms .
so i go back and step back the perspective .
i understood that this is the nature of the art .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
from that time , an anecdote that you may know .
so , i want to give you two , maybe three examples .
so please say , when there &apos;s a music playing .
i have a friend who seeks an adult .
that &apos;s probably the first year of its value , the first year .
and , in fact , you work a lot less than i do .
and then i &apos;ll tell you , that &apos;s unright .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the film .
it &apos;s naturally from asia , which is in the case of japan .
i can say the kanzathlete is a man .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he deceived them .
but , of course , it &apos;s the sum , a lot of ideas .
though , it wasn &apos;t that way in the aference .
have come with investors , i &apos;ve been looking for new neighborhoods .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website .
or b , because she didn &apos;t learn to sing ?
and you know what the answer to all of this is ?
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it feels their urine . they almost never do it .
and we don &apos;t want to do that . our health system is for itself .
they get to ththo mtiki in south africa .
you know , there was no mandates in paradise .
there was no christmas trees . we did it all .
ask , ask the evidence , desires the evidence .
there &apos;s a window build-up .
maniop is something half a billion people eat .
i mean , let &apos;s say , why do we fight this ?
there is no other description of what &apos;s going on here .
i take that hand away , and here &apos;s the knife .
you can just demonstrate that trick and your neighbors . thank you .
that &apos;s a lot of deaths with measens , 20 per hour .
the x-page interpretation of a piece is this kind of thing .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
&quot; the manhattan project ? how are we going to follow ?
and it changed my way of making films , completely .
you have to be ready to take some risks .
well , energy ruisness fell over time .
the people here have contributed to the development of many of these miracles .
it &apos;s the renewables of renewables as they &apos;re often called .
and over the course of this exploration , i learned a lot .
so , from the same , bad team under under the best .
there &apos;s some innovation in the absolute area ; biomechanics , liquid .
a very concrete wish that we can invent this technology .
the fact is that this uncertainty should worry about us .
ceos think about average . but here it gets interesting .
this is what happened . not a team had a strong structure .
i can &apos;t say it &apos;s good or bad .
and the main indicator of it is extinction of languages .
that &apos;s how heads on the piano are the celebrity of my finger .
in 25 years , it &apos;s going to be gone here .
and the proposal was to build many more carbon factories .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t make it .
but rather than panic , he just heard it .
he stopped all the thought , and he did something completely new .
i &apos;m still going to write , because this is my job .
if we start to think about this , changing it .
i &apos;d rather keep doing this work that i love .
and i don &apos;t expect that to change .
one of the ads of the amazon industry at christmas was this .
the most powerful minworkers is the leader of massey capitalism .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it smells too well .
so if i put them together , they open up interest .
now , if we overplay it , we can put back a little back .
this is a quest for me to look at greece , and the old rome .
so i know some of those who haven &apos;t come up .
why do they advertise us when we can &apos;t buy ?
and the world that we now live in now looks like this .
they get a model that emerges from all of the soil .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
a consequence of it was that the phone was never broken .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not . &quot;
as i said , two overfished , it started .
on the last ted conference , i had an introduction to the lhc .
and the question is , are the good or bad news ?
this struck me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
do you want to have the buttons or sticks ? stone or an electron washing ?
economists call this a parateral improvement .
you don &apos;t know anything possible in this goldfish glass . &quot;
this is our recent pth down down right there .
there &apos;s a series of photographs -- here they are .
it &apos;s a form of refour behaviors , right ?
they can throw them away , where they go and stand .
that means that &apos;s where the crime rates go back .
there &apos;s opec a bunch of orphaners .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
when you walk , yes , everybody destroys the ground .
have you ever seen a neutral strain of neutral ?
that &apos;s why we &apos;re thinking about thinking about it .
that is , we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
because we don &apos;t do things anymore .
there is a direct lexicon for this .
you aggregate information about the piece in the secondary literature .
i take the breath of the audience , aware or unconsciously .
even if you were now dumped , you would have emissions .
i will never play as much as in that moment .
i apologize that i have to cut up so much .
but far now , i &apos;m going to do it so n .
and then you &apos;ll notice there &apos;s a change .
and they lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
and then these are dicking causes of industrial civilizations .
we have an abstract abstract language .
these are rooms that can respond to a human .
and the third area , which basically explains itself .
i want to take you to a very specific aspect of curiosity .
and of course , how does creation affect perception .
that &apos;s when it comes back again .
that &apos;s exactly the same thing i mentioned .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
that &apos;s the period of most perceptions that we have .
that &apos;s my meat , and i can rotate that way .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
cats look at cats who watch this video .
you might try to extend the capacity of existing homes .
all parties , everybody checks in the society , supported this .
each of these themes , of course , were , of course , many , many smaller decisions .
i want to talk about the problem and some of the solutions .
we can deal with more categories than more than more more choices .
that &apos;s the piece of metal i &apos;m going to talk about .
and you can see this green spot there in the middle .
so this approach is all new , which is to be creative .
they had the biggest fear of pirates , rape and death .
my mother , my sister and i fell in the same bed .
and the more i talked , the more i should tell you .
possibilities that didn &apos;t have allowed us were unencouraged .
so quantum mechanics says that unmovable objects feel the same .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
they &apos;re going to welcome the fear . be the risk .
you open the map , and you jump on with a click .
this is my brand in my little , distorted industry .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to come .
are you 14 sam and monlenn like 12 ?
well , after all , the film has got a very big momentum .
finally , when we move forward , we should welcome fear .
but what is the trick that makes it realistic ?
so what we &apos;re looking at is a tiny computer chip .
they are , they &apos;re like the end of the gang .
in the previous case , it was about finding the detail .
there are many others , but i don &apos;t have time .
for example , this person would be completely logical .
i don &apos;t see why it should not be like this .
three months later , i was moved , and i went on .
and the movie is ever whistling . &quot;
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
we see the process that feeds itself .
so , if you could ask the light again .
what is this new state that takes the world away ?
and the next interesting stage took about another billion years .
it &apos;s a rather astounding invention when you think about it .
so we &apos;ve got the deadline of time again .
one government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be more efficient .
let &apos;s call the animal shell , it costs a lot of money .
so in other words , i think first of what i want .
so , find programs that can be in the most top number of numbers .
but i really believe that something comes from us .
here &apos;s &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have learned this in my work as a lawyer .
this is essentially what i &apos;m going to talk about .
but what this picture is , is a problem .
the race of software takes a few years .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
secondly , combined photos should be combined with the same lights .
here &apos;s a quick video of what we &apos;re doing .
and they developed great apps , worked with urban employees .
if you don &apos;t do that , you can let you take it .
and it &apos;s completely common , organic , of course .
and as you can see , these are not three separate images .
if a neighbor helps the other , we &apos;re dominating our communities .
and that means public access , which means open and productive .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
turned out to the site . went home .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i mean , i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
i sell in the entire country , the worldwide world .
i hope you &apos;ll be happy . thank you .
you know , we &apos;ll hear a lot about transparency .
play is the tickt that holds us .
in most of my activities , i would have two legs .
is it the other thing for others or is it ?
and our gut is a wonderful alternative environment for these bacteria .
these are the kinds of questions that we need to be facing .
if you have something to give you , there are now .
and no , it &apos;s not cutting or san francisco .
antling me : healthy , powerful , powerful . &quot;
and i can tell you it was a reasonable experience .
under a hat page , i &apos;m involved with the story of anatomy .
and that &apos;s why the testicles are testosterone .
we make androths , and we &apos;re talking about androgen .
if you didn &apos;t move away , you bury it .
now , in practice , people are not tested on their synapses .
how would you want to be better than you are right now ?
you can almost look beautiful for less than 50 dollars .
and this is a little bit hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how do we get away from our memories ?
and my talk today is mostly about these cognitive attacks .
the first of these fall is a disgusting , complexity .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
most of you are completely ignored by remembering themselves .
we think about our future as outlooked memories .
if you &apos;re happy , you get other happy people .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so i want you to think about thought of a thought experiment .
currently we spend three billion hours a week with online games .
you never get any task they can &apos;t solve .
we &apos;re developing communalistic , high-beings beings .
and these were the first of people developed toys .
i &apos;m jtii , and this is my suitcase .
there &apos;s a huge wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
well , in this area there isn &apos;t several thousands of goals .
the idea is to address a digital safety system .
how would you change their relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and if it &apos;s not , then then , then , then it wouldn &apos;t do anything .
so we should find out what the goal is .
they even know they even know the height of the machine &apos;s machine .
here &apos;s a clip from this armed code .
i said , &quot; please fly into the air . &quot;
but in my humanity , i have given that in my own ego .
of course , this cannot be done by a human machine leader .
you could also use regular worm- technology .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the movie .
but i don &apos;t know how limited people will be .
i only wish i could grow my children up .
there are a few places that we can turn to .
you can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
well , today , we know all about where this stuff comes from .
but we just know little about where things go .
but in fact , it was even more fun that night .
it &apos;s at the same time a real-time 3d scan and a movement recording .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
so there &apos;s no excuse for anyone here in this audience .
the revelation of life is a part of life .
this is the average size of a small empire block .
and i &apos;m like , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
it &apos;s called the eyewriter , and you can see the description .
you go around the block and you take it as a revelation .
one of my friends made it -- richard bollywood .
the only problem was that they had 10 children .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
we had no words for what we started there .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 , if a bat &apos;s 300 million hits .
that &apos;s somebody who &apos;s safe for four out of the 10 .
i went home in my way home .
and that was the first time i took this firsthand .
and she said the three words : remember , you remember ?
in both cases , the surgery was done , and it was good .
both of my time to me was , ask me .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
this is a technology innovation that exists today .
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
it &apos;s new spiders on the way , nano-materials .
i know now that it was the case of the sea .
these images are extraordinary because the transition is very quick .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
and the psychology of online criminals are very easy to understand .
it &apos;s certified with hacking hacking and fake certificates .
it was essentially a building block building building our time .
and within years , lego in every household , in every household .
a couple of years ago , i started to develop furnia &apos;s face .
depending on his behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
my grandmother sat at the end of the room and listened to me .
and i thought that this was going to be so painful .
and more and more people would come in , just because they were angry .
in many areas , people were afraid of lynchmobs .
it was the fear of terror , which shaped her life .
and of course it can never be in germany .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re going to try to prevent injustice .
because ultimately our humanity , of our humanity , depends upon our own humanity .
i think that &apos;s true for everybody on the planet .
if someone lies , it &apos;s not just a liar .
sometimes i lose the balance . it &apos;s a story .
i was trying to say something about our justice system .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of them . &quot;
the cost of solar energy was 50 percent in the last year .
that all of our survival survive is linked to each other .
56 percent of all raction attacks are not in court .
i think that &apos;s what we need to do .
it &apos;s more than that , more than fail .
i love this : &quot; watson disforced by human enemies . &quot;
it &apos;s about understanding the emotional language .
it &apos;s about creating distributed goods .
the king of romanan but got aluminum tothers .
so , don &apos;t move and start to invent .
and the set was actually a shot of the tree plans of the ship .
our imagination is a force that actually can create a reality .
so the program that i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
so i decided that i was going to be 15 .
it wasn &apos;t a film , not a hd , this was real .
and it was an experience that i could not afford to have .
so that really blew me up , and i wanted to go .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re going to build a chance , not high .
i wasn &apos;t there a long time ago with miguel .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons for everyone on the planet .
and somehow we need to make changes that are going to reduce at zero .
now that &apos;s a basic algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
usually , you &apos;re just like , and some of them are not .
because if the water is flowing , it falls down in the atlantic .
what we need is a lot of companies working on it . hundreds .
yes , this is the burden of the bottom there .
and then we started to negotiate with the pole .
human beings should come from the monkey or have common ancestors .
and she asked him what are your hobbies ?
you feel that this is the real truth behind the counter .
here you need some logic , but the willingness to lie .
secondly , if it &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
and the uranium will use gradually gradually , a bit like a candle .
they did that by taking off the land .
and then you see what the enormous amount of choices there are .
this first one was more like a passionate choice .
these feed of elected to 1 , said he said .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
this second fish , this is another kind of love story .
now , where are we going to go : what is the right approach ?
there was time now as an instrument at all .
i know what people think when they see this .
okay , so let me take a little bit of blood .
we can imagine this time machine on everything that we want .
and when i turn around , the fingers change its position .
now , what did this have to do with the placebo effect ?
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
and it turns out that not all is it .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have any consequences .
what about polio ? do we take this . why not ?
we &apos;re going to meet a couple of times in the next few days .
these are real patients who &apos;ve taken a painful approach .
they were asked to report every 60 seconds about their pain .
it &apos;s got eye views of life , one after one .
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
and then people could eat the food and wouldn &apos;t be blind .
i wonder that , you know , you forget something very basic .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
so there should be a nine at the beginning of my death row .
an nuclear reactor , which gives itself a solution to the waste .
and this is a thought of a thought that i think is appropriate .
normally , most people start voting themselves on the task .
they invest in a lot of their time together .
specialized skills and processor skills and their combination lead to success .
so , if we go back , what would the 2020 mean ?
i don &apos;t need that , but vaccines are essential .
smallpox . smallpox smallpox killed billions of people on this planet .
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s face it .
you can just call a few names , and people will understand .
i mean , you can choose your own list .
does any one in the audience will see anyone who sees any of these things ?
and also , what you would think about today is the right time .
this meant that he was murdered by the chinese invasion .
and then i ask , how did this diagnosis was this diagnosis ?
it &apos;s like asking someone to swallow the sun .
i &apos;m probably not going to take away all of you in this journey .
it means that we have a cultural impact next to the scientific impact .
a recent statement that you can do about your lifestyle .
please follow me , because the circle will come together .
if your work -- not entirely your mistakes , right ?
that &apos;s how people in the west have really thought about creativity .
i think it &apos;s quite obvious in terms of what we need .
now how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
in fact , he can sometimes feel parmal times .
she said it would be like a swamp train of air .
and i guess a lot of you have done it too .
this is one of the most painful adventures of a creative life .
and the predictions that they read are serious .
on the 10th of september , last year , the machine was running first .
support america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
clinical depression was exploding in the industrial world in the last generation .
we can shift from the poster to a physical sense of this environment .
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
i won &apos;t tell you because i want to use it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on humans .
and i think it &apos;s taking the world this way .
most people know this from the software system .
this is the publication that we did recently .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
and , if we can , we can start the chromosome ?
one chromosome is like , by the way , a piece of chemical material .
so , this looks like a basketball placge .
you can see in the upper field that his chromosome is just falling apart .
this is in our entire largest world &apos;s second waste of america .
maybe this is an artificial way to read an artificial book .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
the things that are only being used are going into technical systems .
here &apos;s one of the evidence that men are not pigs .
here it says , the more you are moving , the better .
because it &apos;s uncomfortable to go and take nutrients .
this is , of course , high-tech agriculture , but it &apos;s operating itself .
and , first of all , to ask what the right thing is .
and because we get older , the wind gets bigger .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
interpretations are the papers of the written notes .
the cligging notes have the function of the letters of a book .
you study the works that he previously created and after afterwards .
i play what these sounds could have to say .
to keep siesia , directly with the composers .
they &apos;re all in the preterior stage .
well , there , pick and b , and b , etc .
and today , we &apos;re very , very strong with stories .
and they did this with something called lelelandmaps .
i think somehow six hundred dollars or something like that .
so , i think it &apos;s a very nice hack .
and i think technology is becoming more important in our modern societies .
and that &apos;s the core issue of the biohacker .
and these are only biohacker , which individual people .
so , i think there was a really good code .
but also our perception itself , how does it make us .
that is , you have navigiated via sounds and about rhythm .
we went back to what &apos;s called &quot; vogy age .
and other other examples are the ambials , smart systems .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be with you .
now no longer on the local level , but it &apos;s a global level .
so you can ask : how happy is it the living self ?
&quot; because she said this morning , he said .
and the other thing is , is that , in the fourth , or fifth row .
but on youtube , more than 48 hours of video per minute .
now there &apos;s 10,000 lynares of &quot; friday &quot; at youtube .
we don &apos;t just find sympathy from something ; we &apos;re doing it .
the words , as long as his friends , we got away now .
i knew she came up to say goodbye .
autocolors , using the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
they have to make it make 62 different decisions by designing your car .
it &apos;s impossible to say how the photo was made .
and yeah , i have a job of how you might recognize .
and over 10,000 marinuoes have been put in the netherlands .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do any government technology .
you &apos;ve got to imagine the enormous challenges you have to imagine .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
in fact , we &apos;re also such a scale community .
50 percent of their decisions were made within nine minutes or less .
it was a store that was called a kite .
i mean , it &apos;s just what my logical explanation says .
in the meantime , i was focused on a talk at tedglobal .
and a new city also includes new ways of dealing with leaders .
do you know how much decisions do you make on a typical day ?
do you know how much decisions do you make in a typical week ?
the invention of language was a little step into that direction .
this is a very uncomfortable controller .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; throw . &quot;
they &apos;re always concerned about losing the course of the ocean .
okay . every one of them is ready , gary &apos;s offer .
because those categories tell me how i can keep them apart .
one is called &quot; jazz , &quot; and the other is called &quot; carpet . &quot;
and every living is using the exact same letter , and the same code .
well , i &apos;m also playing with you , but not very often .
that means that the player is safe for three out .
and this is the message that i took in medical school .
fall 8 : tsunieswarning . 9 / cyber attacks .
recession . gridlock . doomsday , egypt . syria .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is accessible .
in 2010 , we had just connected to two billion people online .
i want to end with a story that really excites me .
bryan stevenson : well , there are ways .
a few months after , and i had just forgotten everything .
i sent them back to home without my high doctor .
if you &apos;re recorrect and never make the mistake again .
and it turned out that he &apos;s been infection .
some of my sound happened in the last five years .
and the fish also was fortunate to be there .
we tear out from the rhetoric of the punishment punishment .
but what if you want to see the brush ?
their parents were born in 1840s in virginia as slaves .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
my story starts right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i found that technology should be possible and not killing killing .
so you have to throw the ipad here , and the fireflies suck .
and we bring them back in a contemporary history for children .
she was a delicate , great woman , she had effect .
because all of these new technologies today are feeding themselves .
i had a 14-year-old , poor black young young boys .
the united states today has the highest incarceration rate of the world today .
in my opinion , mass sentencing our world has radically changed .
innovation , creativity , and development is not just from our heads .
we want to fight judgment and discrimination in the criminal justice system .
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
and here &apos;s a really large close-up of the little piece of metal .
we found this in terms of the happiness itself .
now , where would you put your brain on this scale ?
if the child is born , she looks like a girl , she looks like a girl .
and with that , they have really wonderful ways of doing the future movement .
bruno guissani : mark , mark , come back .
this is the world of wild bonobos in the jungle forest of congo .
only that i think it &apos;s more like it , right ?
right now , if it &apos;s barely appropriate , you might end up the most .
and as a result , we can use the word &quot; humanity . &quot;
he said , &quot; release , you must go to the house .
there are five million people in the world in the world .
i mean , what makes somebody with so many assets ?
so i &apos;m going to show you just what i brought up .
i brought seven of underpants , and that &apos;s all .
and i really want to show you my outfits of this week .
i &apos;d like to end and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
if we &apos;re in cities , that &apos;s actually a big thing .
we need to begin to turn the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event that &apos;s been returned for 2,500 years .
it &apos;s going to affect politics , i think , in the years .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i throw video games .
and i don &apos;t mean just less successful , even though it belongs .
how can we transmit these feelings from play into reality ?
ok , imagine how the extreme self-sustainable approaches .
we can actually make the same things in effect with less energy .
can you imagine something good from tobacco ?
in front of these phenomenal game controllers , there was sheep decold .
i would argue we &apos;re ready for our own epic game .
and thank god , i didn &apos;t use a census dictionary .
or do you want to be more willing to have more strength .
i wanted us to live a long and healthy life .
think of this as the image of aviation .
when we looked at how feelings are changing with income .
a eight year-old play . how is your brand ?
we went to sao paulo , where lawsuits had been banned .
and the film is going to spell &quot; the furever ever . &quot;
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
and so all these companies disappeared , one after the other .
and what happened was i needed a experts .
this is what i did . the first picture is a photograph of my family .
and if we &apos;re vulnerable , really bad things can happen .
and guess what we &apos;ve found in the winter code ?
it &apos;s actually just a two-two weeks .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
click , and wwins , you &apos;re in this museum .
if the museum has given us the image , they click on it .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
so all these green areas , these are the target environments .
let &apos;s go quickly to moma , again , new york .
think , it &apos;s free , none of us deserves it .
and that urgency , this goal , really changed my life .
imagine that every single one of human beings is being controlled .
that &apos;s what we want to do as a possible impulse for the transcendent fire .
they interact in explicit ways with their environment and their experiences .
we &apos;ve taken his bed to see that he can see .
that &apos;s what keeps us at the pole and makes us evolve .
imagine this image of the puzzle could really start flying .
these centriches in iran are divided in 15 things .
i didn &apos;t spend two years anymore with my wife .
almost like we were preparing our lives .
and i &apos;m like a little kid .
they knew all sorts of pieces and bybyed them .
looks pretty ancient . it looks like furged manes .
they wanted to kill them because they could eat them well .
and by the end , you just want to get the ancestor of real remains .
well , because they don &apos;t know it was different .
because through ocean protected reserves , we &apos;re basically following the past .
there were mountains a long time ago -- 500 years ago .
and that &apos;s what happens in the case of regulinotar .
in those records , there was a folder called the finines .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out with this .
whewell &apos;s electronic panels , which have a specific function .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
and so before , an spanish company with environmental awareness has bought the country .
i asked him how to do such a fish expert .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t you know what &apos;s sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he &apos;s not . he &apos;s going to ask questions .
let &apos;s call it miguel . in fact , he &apos;s called miguel .
this is a fish growing up in the south western corner of spain .
well , they couldn &apos;t do it , not economic .
because a good engineer is either awesome , or nuclear power plants .
same forces with opposite incidents of litigation , each one of them .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely selfish .
she &apos;s the last abpire before something goes back into the body .
look at miguel , farmer like tenguel .
and who &apos;s going to see that is especially true of men .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
the brown is like the conventional system , the green is our system .
we &apos;re just going to play the cost of manufacturing . it doesn &apos;t trace out .
and as i &apos;m telling the word justice , this emotion route .
and he says , you know , i &apos;m in the fire fire .
no need to whistle a sike to whistle or to sing .
whether the music is rotating or too sweet .
why do i ask you to be active from my audience that it &apos;s also active ?
because the music is a language and a language is to communicate .
a piece of art you never have , doesn &apos;t have an impact .
no glory , no honor , no money . what are you doing ?
because he doesn &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be going on first .
i want to argue now what we found in my institute .
now this is a three-set that describes us a logic .
so lying is that they can maintain this logic just false .
the first sentence is , you know , there &apos;s no soul .
but the key is , if i &apos;m right , it is .
and from here , i can go into the side and go again .
our vocal chorets to sing , our hands and feet .
there &apos;s a deception to something , because somebody perceives it .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
she wouldn &apos;t bribe her child against child diabetes ; no crash .
why ? because we have no child disease , and you know what ?
we love to sink in lie . we love that .
well , i think i understand -- we hate the drug industry .
we hate a strong government . we have no confidence in the system .
he took us from one of the worst failures of humanity .
and you can do that because they can &apos;t connect the cause and a correlation .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who among them has suffered more ? &quot;
in terms of the living self , b was clearly a bad time .
well , those two types of self put two sets of happiness .
we know something about the happiness of happiness itself .
don &apos;t worry , not a quach , a child , go .
now , how do you begin to talk the language of music ?
because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
many of you will say , they &apos;re nuts ! that &apos;s good .
and the alarm of your team is more important than all the lorets of the world .
not a major deal , the innovation was given no longer to risk .
co2 wares the planet , and the equation for co2 is really pretty clear .
it turns out , if you can get it to zero .
now , i was wondering , how can i get this really big ?
and we were going to be a for a 12-year family period .
so the question is : can we do this ? i guess .
but as you have been talking with other people around the world .
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptics don &apos;t live in very different camps .
you make the mistakes right now , and you pay a lot later .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy how little it is supporting .
so i offered a 10,000-dollar prize to software for the winner .
the melody comes out of the perfect and the rhythm of the dance .
but the waorani did not only kill the outside .
you learn the notes to find the notes on the instrument .
but even myself in my black color sometimes , sometimes i &apos;ve punched this thing up .
is i see that i could just write a song to write ?
it wickes blue because of the genes we put .
they have recently seen corn corn , which is just a bad experiment .
it &apos;s scaling co2 from methane to the use of hydrogen as a source of energy .
i have to tell you , i think it was a big mistake .
but the question i want to say is , why not ?
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
beautiful beach . awesome day . you &apos;ve got it all for yourself .
i began to think i should just erase the project .
keep on your contribution , whatever it is .
i believe that , and i feel like we should teach this .
and in the andes , this glacier is the drinking water source for that city .
but when they collide , most of the water will drop away .
this is not a electron microscope that &apos;s a standard image .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most fundamental problem .
it &apos;s an independent area . you all control all the assets .
this is a whole book , an example of nonvisual data .
on the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical view .
christianity , islam , buddhism , trinidad or whatever .
it won &apos;t create any distortion of reality , but the resolution of reality .
the father of this young man was identified as the followers of the shark lama .
the modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old .
so the alliance of climate protection has started two campaigns in life .
should i be answering this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
this is fucking house house of dickens . every column is a chapter .
it cuts up on the top of the space of nasa .
this is actually live live on the internet . you can check it .
but in fact , the realities of the imagery is actually meaning .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what we can get modern progress .
in california , a 40 percent reduction in snow was seen in the aquarium .
but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of the forest that was amazing .
because the france plant could best get the phosphorus back .
and we &apos;re going to replace the oil by different energy .
and this is this projection of vision , looking for feedback , vision .
so , for example , the environment , the fuel less car .
we could reduce that for 10 percent , but what does it do ?
so the question is , how do we deal with these windwaves ?
so we don &apos;t need to control the people as much bad .
and these two worlds just converge together , new and old thinking .
so i was busy looking at what was of course or intuition .
when you throw away the wrong stuff , you have a waste problem .
that &apos;s why they help it with them , ask them questions .
so , again , in every store you can get the things back .
now , there are a lot of people working with mit , and they can be engaged .
how were his circumstances , like the society and politics ?
the next phenomenon , which is very interesting is the visual vision .
and then the same thing happens in a good way .
the interesting thing is , when i can make a small trip .
the real tool of information training has been stories since recently .
you connect it with a certain note and it tends to hire it .
and then we &apos;ve created this kind of cool .
so the device that you see , it doesn &apos;t work .
and what &apos;s interesting is that even in southeast asia .
in part , with these hacking spaces , these places are encoded there .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
and that &apos;s what i had the last half-year .
this goes back much further into the cultures of the pre-industrial era .
so , we &apos;ve got a bit of god a little bit far from god .
what has lights on our thinking and on our memories ?
which incidentally , of course , comes up and it &apos;s a computer game .
and with a kind of lightning light , we can get these virtual worlds .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
and you can do that through these sorts of techniques , but also through crowdsourcing .
but where would be the next agged to help this patient ?
three things : tastemaker , domtating facilities and the unexpected .
&quot; nyan &apos;s &quot; is an animation and the music loop .
and today we &apos;re all comfortable as owners of our pop culture .
for example , the fish had been taken on a channel .
this is my wireless scale . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
when i start with the simple , i &apos;m learning how to choose .
every single harvard employee is now taking place on a lifetime of time .
so , what did we do ? we did this in the netherlands .
how did he get to look for aid in this particular way ?
we now know nine cities now , and we &apos;re planning to use this app .
and these people know something we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
every single one of you could be famous to next saturday .
this is a slide that i &apos;ve chosen from my folder .
so here i &apos;ll make it something . we look right there at the center .
they just do the construction of apartments to the city of cities .
why is it important to start modern ? what represents the red ?
one big sacrifice is what we call the risk .
big data , for organizations around the world , transformed in large opportunities .
this image , for example , has about 10 billion points , i think .
but at the same time , we need a good range of intuition to actually do the experiments .
these little oil droplet were in sense of the most primitive cell form .
and what we found was that in fact there was a context .
and they said , &quot; let &apos;s present the head of the country . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
a million people each year are latin latin and hop in the united states .
how good do you think they &apos;re making decisions ?
this business , it was almost like a pleasure system .
and what &apos;s below it is what we call bureaucracy .
man 5 : brand reformer alcohol .
what about a sentence of new , never heard of hearing .
what about treaties that we can &apos;t even predict ?
so bryan , they actually brought a string to vibrate .
so the amygdala is our early warning system , our risk detector .
the basis of a lot of them makes technologies , and these are expanding externally .
and the best part is perhaps what we would expect in health .
by 2020 , we &apos;re going to eliminate two to five billion internet users .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what are you doing in the lawroom ? &quot;
from my eye angle , i saw the janitors and down .
do you know how to get a 300ter in major league baseball baseball ?
and i was good , i lock off with ck .
and it was working for a while until i met the dodo printer .
and when i listened to her , she &apos;s ringing sounds .
and i made my first mistake ; i would send them home .
well , in fact , the number of violent crimes is not very changed .
so maybe the interview should be a little bit about this interview . &quot;
and this is going to grow and gets it up and serves in the rest of the book .
i say that because i believe that identity is very important .
because their life depended on whether they did the job right .
this piece of 50 year-old technology became the magical thing for me .
it &apos;s taking pictures and text together , and animation , sounds and touch .
i &apos;m just going to go to la hamya , which is an interactive ipad app .
fantasy ybooks have always been maps , but these maps were static .
we have a lot of cells that are no longer laid on themselves .
finally , i went from my car , and i went to the court .
in 197197two , 300,000 people were living in delhi and in prison .
we all need to believe things that we can &apos;t see .
she said , &quot; this will make you very , very tired . &quot;
i embody these kids too hard to get defenders .
how can a judge turn somebody into something that it isn &apos;t ?
what context is to the thought and feelings about them ?
this is a hedor of the photographer , phil toledano .
i like a lot of black colors , lots of sound sound and such a stuff .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
in order to adapt to a deeper world , we need to play .
when we look forward , these kinds of changes will be possible as possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it &apos;s not surprising that these destruction also survive to the bonobos .
bonobos -- how humans -- love to play their lives .
so sex games are distributed , both of the bonobos and humans .
and one night , there &apos;s a pat on his hotel room door .
are we in a kind of evolutionary equilibrium in a form of species ?
as a result , the body evolves more than the typical rural course .
okay , just a quick example of interhumanity .
and our nation is truly based on a very romantic concept of individualism .
and i had to explain the journalist that it doesn &apos;t exist .
in our study , we &apos;re in all sorts of unsilly spaces .
would you not want it to do these changes in their genes ?
but a lot of people are moving into a very strange position .
and if you can make it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
and i tend to see widrities as my shadow .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , from two reasons .
so that can play together with bonds , trust and another .
they create a epic source of knowing the world of warcraft .
we &apos;re going to play games to get out of the real world .
and i hope you &apos;ll play with me like this and play .
this is what we call perceptual design in our lab .
ah , the majority . the li i like to do as a doctor .
we &apos;re living for a human who has value for our society .
so again , change and customization are the great skills of human beings .
if you ask me this , i &apos;m not so sure .
which would you like to have , if you could have one ?
some . probably so many of them have creative people here .
we find other other curious faith on what their rights are .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a graduate student .
and that gave us great confidence for that that we were looking at here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that didn &apos;t just happen .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i &apos;d like to share with you about today .
i &apos;m sad that each one we never learned as adults .
i was the only person who could talk to the airplane .
i became the wonder of that day , that day .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
so the drawings were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it comes out of a magic panel .
and neither the machine leaders , nor the security system will notice .
we need to ask the consequences , and we start getting ready to get care of it .
but again , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
these people will be connected to the movie in sleep -- forever .
so , sir , can you help me ? i need help .
temple will be part of the show , which is pretty little .
so , you see , with this film , we wanted to share the true version .
you see the person who &apos;s going on what &apos;s going on inside the inside .
he precipitated about 120 feet , or 40 meters .
for half-age , people make a short call , go to the toilet .
well , that night , everybody went to the center to celebrate .
but this is going to happen a lot more unuseful , and more complicated things .
it &apos;s causing a waterpressure with a water disorder from water .
and we got the assignment to design a building at the back of the expo .
this would call you , in engineering teams , a real-time control system .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back in the room room .
my life is really truly blessed by working on some amazing projects .
temple was one of the leading graffiti artist of the 1980s .
did anybody see the movie &quot; butterfly , &quot; seen ? &quot;
so we &apos;ve created a device that is completely free of constraints .
every paralyzed can actually communicate with its eyes to its eyes , or draw .
they say that you will never forget the names of those who die .
there are us in front of the ininototar .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only worse .
we have tredigic of kids , and we see it playing with play .
lights , sound , solar elements , motors -- everything should be available .
you add a blue one in a green , and you can make light .
and the best part is that they connect with magnets .
but there &apos;s a major difference : the transistor was just for experts .
concrete blocks have been very rapidly the most prolific building unit in the world .
i looked into the raps , and it was a little bit pink .
and i gave him a ditch for penicillin and sent him to him .
because there &apos;s something that has been lost in a certain way .
this shows the vast big role of a marine reserve .
so nothing changed , and yet everything changed .
let me conclude with three of my own words : i remember .
in this state , about 24,000 canadians , he killed every single mistakes .
he had a potentially living disease called coregltitis .
it &apos;s a hummer for dough , which is fear in the darkness .
so i can zoom in in the course of my course .
here &apos;s the whole demonstration of the entire demonstration that i gave up to this point .
so , what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical living diagram of age .
and if we can make this for raw raw data , why not use it for content ?
it &apos;s just to see if you take a step back and look at it .
so we can jump and look at all the ted prize winner .
and so i want to show you something else that might be a little surprise .
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
we are not a more realistic , we enjoy it . we are lover .
so that &apos;s all good for the science of science .
in sydney , i wanted to dive down to the real wreck of the titanic .
well , they were also too technologically and sophisticated planning .
and i fly with a little robotic stuff through the backs of the ship .
they don &apos;t exist in a scale of sunlight , as we do .
this is the one that comes back on two billion years of labor .
nasa has one of the favorite sentence , &quot; fail is not an alternative . &quot;
so , finally , a company that was trying to do it right .
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world .
in the course of three of the fish , two will always wait .
it &apos;s a very , very large battery . it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
if you take it down somewhere , it &apos;s a long time .
the base reserves has at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and we can go out with this big battery two milliseconds in time .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fishing eggs to the birds .
so i called the next day , shortly before the event , don &apos;t know .
he came up to the table with a bright , long white paint .
who can make a fish so tasty after it got caught ?
it &apos;s near the contract of the river at the stream of the river .
they raised meat beef on what &apos;s basically wetlands .
but i didn &apos;t understand much about leadership before i came to this gathering .
there was the core of the core research facility .
in fact , we don &apos;t want to do that between the experience . we choose to be involved in memories of experiences .
well , these are three weeks , and that &apos;s the highest one and a half .
it &apos;s not about turning genes around . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
right now , it &apos;s in the present tense , but we have an incredible opportunity .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
or , &quot; what was your journey to albania ? &quot; or something like that .
very , very important , and in this case , dominated the end .
that &apos;s okay , you like to pay 28 billion dollars in the dark of urine .
he just developed a few other people with a rota-virus vaccine .
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for eye views is a pretty complicated process .
they were playing the box for 18 years ; we were practicing for 16 years .
it &apos;s an online game where you have to overcome the oil scarcity .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a very different world .
it &apos;s a beautiful showgirl , a gorgeous showgirl .
and all i can say is , why do we fight it ?
if i don &apos;t have the right , the canary is not a man .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
i think that really is , and no , it &apos;s not wishthinking .
i came up and geocentr, geographically , fusion and biofuels .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can do it .
and it &apos;s sitting there for 60 years , and then it &apos;s finished .
tech expensive that kind of collaboration as the core of a iterative endeavor .
and with every attempt , the children get immediate feedback , and what doesn &apos;t .
every americans about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
and this is something that we need to learn very quickly .
and soon after that , i wrote an article about compechic foods .
we type , we &apos;re rich , we &apos;re going to eat , that &apos;s okay .
these were people , educated people , educated people .
we &apos;ve been trained to see if this was true .
we should be done to be done ; this is a serious issue .
i &apos;ve been working on the collective 11 years , which was more democratic .
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new life opportunities .
because , in fact , we would need to see whether it &apos;s the soul or not .
and finally , a solution that is large enough to solve our problems .
and it turned out that he &apos;s only wanted to stack the sictier .
this is the canino swahili river in southern west greenland .
the united states is one of the two largest harbus , along with china .
it &apos;s affordable , and it &apos;s intimidating , and the workers stay in porers and bread .
so let &apos;s run a tour of this modern , clean coal plant .
we need to put care of america with 100 percent electricity , within the next 10 years .
it &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel .
i think it &apos;s better when we encourage our great creative styles .
every one has four different variations ; you can pick out what you want to use .
and that actually took a thousand eight eight figures in the form of these networks .
so this is just an application of many , you can do this .
and so that &apos;s opening open open and citizen science .
i wrote four words , and i just want to explain to you briefly .
you &apos;re all good . the question is , how is we going to get us .
of course , this virtual world lives in the walls of our cities , it &apos;s clear .
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
i couldn &apos;t have better able to do it better . i didn &apos;t go down .
if you want to see the functions of these cars , you can see them here .
of course , the mapping is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
this is actually a poster of notre dame that was right .
but how about that image you &apos;re linked to all your images ?
they rented your phone . you didn &apos;t buy it .
and look , how do we process information , how do we take information ?
people said , &quot; ken have no fear , never have success ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is it is .
these organisms can completely be completely used , and they can even live in a vacuum .
to put it in my context , i was born in birth .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all sorts of different ways .
books writing is my job , but of course , is more than that .
whereas the language of language was subconscious .
we also did something in the corner of this particular basis of the guardian .
listen consciously and say , you know , it tastes to you or not .
i say ulf , what do you need so n big car ?
and he asked me what the conventions of this baloade would be for me .
every time it &apos;s exciting , because again i &apos;m reading something new .
if that &apos;s wrong , the students will get the next difficult piece .
the continual conalltion nowadays is not predictable .
but let me say , i don &apos;t know about classical music .
the composer is increasingly becoming more to friend , with whom you &apos;re living with .
the work of the playful starts to start with the same way of a theater textbook .
the spanish painter pquilo picasso once suggested a woman .
and then one day the mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a beauty .
she likes to love him especially , because he has a slope to the ordinator .
it &apos;s a little bub that doesn &apos;t care about fire .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s not going to stop , physical nature .
all that affects me and all that affects my experience with composition .
and if i &apos;m right , the canary is a man .
you can have nuplileons , if you &apos;re not there .
we &apos;re going to make agriculture in brazil in where we are protecting nutrients .
and the most important thing is to look at the ground as first .
you can only be nuclear neutral if you don &apos;t exist , right ?
there are still six hundred years of trees in the amazonas alone .
you &apos;ve heard about that from a lot of trees from trees ?
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful to what oil consumption is .
because everybody talks about energy , but nobody is talking about the phosphorus problem .
the point of letters is obvious when you can do the language .
right , we can get this way of nutrients in agriculture .
that &apos;s six countries that control 40 percent of the oil supplies .
a woman in germany eats about six plaths in her lifetime .
and i &apos;m not so sure whether you &apos;re really floating .
and that would be the letters that you learned to paint .
but there is a third possibility , a tempting , fascinating and terrifying .
in the short time , i realized that ted has an identity .
she said , &quot; my love ? &quot; i said , &quot; yeah . &quot;
and the next steps , like electronics , seem to be a few decades .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor does in connection .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic were replaced by machines .
a child in india says , &quot; today , i saw a monkey . &quot;
it &apos;s also why , for example , is growing antibiotics .
i looked at her and smiled , but she looked very seriously .
and that &apos;s what i want to look at on the time scale of the earth .
of course my grandmother would tell all of her , she was something special .
but somehow we do it from this problem .
but for the african-american americans in this country , it was a time of terror .
they come from ideas that are driven by the confidence in our hearts .
so this allows us to go back to a unified organism .
and so i think that the ted community should be tay .
and not even like a tech business , but rather like the internet itself .
and that apps we have to use our hands to improve our communities .
but this picture is completely composed , made out of photographs of different places .
maybe you may know this , i &apos;ve got over 4,000 subbeings on twitter .
and they found that the city was never fed into this fire hydrant .
you &apos;re betting to it freely if it snows .
i think too many places of poverty is the opposite of poverty justice .
it &apos;s not political , which is office frestically active .
now , why do you draw graphs on semi-logarithmic curves ?
and we will not improve the government until we improve citizenship .
i &apos;m going to start by showing you a single , boring slide .
in other words , every step here is a power in the performance scale .
a little bit more brighter because i &apos;m going to draw on the paper right here .
as a young lawyer , i wrote the great privilege to meet pink parks .
so it &apos;s more about taking an idea , just a moment .
the reason for this : the government could follow behind where a text came from .
it shows evidence of what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
and basically , the bottom of the sea came down and then thrown back .
they were not eaten , they threw them away because they were dead .
of course , a lot of people , scientists , confirm that it was really different .
they also had to name a sheet of astrotext from that typewriter .
i don &apos;t know what you do , but i can live with that .
and this is one of the three main sources of these existing issues today .
what you need is an environment which is inside it .
they had this program for 280,000 euros to the egyptian government .
they &apos;re prefabricated , light , clay , engine and sensor .
it &apos;s actually a lot of the easy play , is actually a powerful amount of powerful .
the idea behind the remdevil is that it &apos;s a growing library .
until the &apos; 80s in the &apos; 80s , he was caught in great style .
at midnight , the monk and said he had to close the cog .
16 percent of aawatts power all of these eightages on the earth &apos;s surface .
and i think it starts with a physician , and that is me .
police officers were coming in and supppugent prosecutor and bureauworkers .
two : famine in somalia . the 30th : play-doh spray of police .
this is the result of faster computers that build faster computers .
today , we can do dozens of companies that have done exactly this .
sometimes these ideas of our thinking of thinking , in a very important way .
we live on a planet that is covering 70 percent of water .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely valid .
it &apos;s a lot better . it &apos;s on the rising line .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in that particular note .
and it wasn &apos;t because of my high doctor , he was very upset .
how can i teach you my mistakes so that they don &apos;t make the same thing ?
so the first law is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
this is all reality today , and the future is going to be much more possible .
photos like this : a construction site along a much stewn street .
and the plastic bottle that we seem to throw away every day .
it &apos;s something that we &apos;re working on for the olympics in london .
i grew up with a mother who taught me a day .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i &apos;m going to donate this all over again .
so if we do something about the cities , it &apos;s a big deal .
in a way , it &apos;s almost as if the old dream of michelangelo ...
and so , if we think about it , we have an interesting situation before we think about .
and the question was : how could you use technology , new technology ?
so how are we going to ask the question of the characteristics of the character ?
it has digitized all of this , knowledge , and making it available through the internet .
it &apos;s a physical shape in london , but it &apos;s covered with imagery .
as a iceberg , i &apos;m cutting up his latest atmosphere .
and just like that , the iceberg is a different side of his personality .
he said , &quot; tell me what &apos;s a female female . &quot;
she saved my life , and my partner and i rescued her .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about individualism .
it &apos;s because of what happened in 1776 with the founding fathers .
but nothing was invented , which would go back to me until now .
but unfortunately , we overtransition this aspect in the narrative of human evolution .
so here &apos;s a young female and a males in a toy game .
for the professional and people equally , life doesn &apos;t live from teeth and meat alone .
the idea behind the stuxnet computer worm is pretty straightforward .
and it makes me really in terms of democracy about democracy .
we have two creatures , both in middle eastern 1979 , at the exact same day .
democracy grew up , but at the same time , the science grew up .
they talk about the power of nature around who we are .
so , for example , i want to give a fish to the same rights as a human .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from anatomy .
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony .
this is indeed true of human and machine .
it &apos;s been built two cities in china , and the third is open .
go from the little choice to the many , then stay there .
you know how uncomfortable it is in a crowded elevator ?
so it turns out it &apos;s very hard to get all these extensions .
he sued out of e tavio , his superclone .
the other place that has been interested in urban construction is singapore .
i remember a kid playing on a ground threshold .
my friends from hong duras asked me , thank you ted .
it &apos;s not as if they &apos;re both exclusive or whatever .
if you want to know , these other peaks are free .
what kind of books do you have to write , where you can write it ?
the odch out of the salmon were coming out of the rest of the world .
before i leave the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
so , i went on to do this a couple of years ago .
at age 17 , she became the second woman of a paycheck her mother .
if you look at the people that you have to do it ...
if you could do it for it , they could help me .
so we needed to have theories about these goals that we could select or unprove .
and often we just ran into a hot circle , and we needed to start to collect it .
and if you do that , eventually you get a cyberweapon weapon .
now this is this brand that is the postmeter stadium .
these gray boxes that you see here , these are real-time control systems .
man 4 : my brand is fedex , because i was .
in order to go close , you can go to the cracks .
i like things that are appealing . i like some weird things .
today , more than ever before , it gives us a little bit very long .
we then got a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
we want to create every single interaction in the world into a utilitarian genome .
so it &apos;s not interesting that there is a strong effect that there is a strong effect ?
it &apos;s a blog where you can see the marshmallow .
and it goes on to nine billion . that &apos;s going to move to nine billion .
now , if i use the term &quot; miracle &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
and because you burn these 99 percent , the gas base is much better .
does the big possible breakthroughs , this is the biggest thing you know ?
if you put a massage geology on the team , you &apos;re going to do significantly better .
that leads to starvation . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to uncertainty .
it &apos;s immensely important . it &apos;s a good patch for marketing . &quot;
that &apos;s up , and it goes very quickly , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
we talk about it with small promissions that is like : &quot; progress . &quot;
it &apos;s true , we have a huge food problem , but that &apos;s not science .
the knife that you can study ; my hand , you can study .
and that , despite any pharmaceutical -- it &apos;s just sugar pills .
and the answer is , until we get near zero , the temperature becomes rising .
i &apos;ll take something which is obviously a deception , and i &apos;ll make it look real .
i said , &quot; miguel , don &apos;t blow your fish ? &quot;
he looked at me as if i just quoted a song from whitney houston .
we can also flip a hundred megawatts of photovoltac to the web .
there &apos;s going to be a whole bunch of controversiers and arguments .
&quot; don &apos;t , &quot; i said , &quot; what is sustainable proteins ? &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of your food is chicken ? &quot;
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of argentina .
i would feed my arm and show you that there are no wounds .
and then we did that and we managed to do a competitive advantage .
i &apos;ll just show you the top 500 most popular wikioden .
so i can go back to a step and go directly to a specific context .
and if we know we can even help wisdom from this .
and my love to the ocean holds , with the same intensity as usual and ever .
so , the films of the way , the images and the stories together . that together .
when you take them , you &apos;re still more effective than a pill and every shape .
on this island , this is the island of gracing ice on the azes .
if all the answers say , i feel like i &apos;ve won .
but only when i turned 30 , i really understood what that means .
evolution really drives the creatures that adapt the best to the environment .
these are decisions which have their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , are going to be , you know .
but it &apos;s also about aging population , whose numbers multiplied .
in a fraction of a second , i lost all of my feeling and all the movement below my palace .
he had an extreme form of a natural side of a natural side of the kidney .
and the key thing about this study was that the teacher didn &apos;t freak out .
and the one student will fund clothes , get better teachers , so they get better teachers .
we should be able to shoot everything that we want .
and this is transforming the interaction that we have on humans with our environment .
well , today , our environment is the very first time to answer us .
in the early afternoon , people here and there , the phone calls .
and if we were to show that people , then we can move into a behavior of behavior .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for super-sex . &quot;
and maybe i think maybe i &apos;m going to show you the trip that i &apos;m trying to show you .
we think in reality , we &apos;re not as good as play .
so you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours .
and she was much worse for a than b for b .
and what a story draws is turnnant , profound moments and ends .
it &apos;s the limited resource that we use while we &apos;re in the world .
well , they would know something about the scale , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
this is a player who &apos;s standing on the edge of a bin-an victory .
we don &apos;t just tell stories when we &apos;re doing to tell stories .
and he said , &quot; well , you may not remember me .
so the big question is , &quot; what exactly are the players good ? &quot;
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world .
not like me -- i develop games , i &apos;m a little bit rough .
there &apos;s these ancient cube , made out of sheep &apos;s muves . you know ?
we &apos;ve created the game called superfix ct at the institute for the future .
when you build more diapers of each other , the system starts to fail .
it &apos;s a picture i took only last april in the north of the amazon .
those were all kfa , also the jewish name called kfa .
and , unfortunately , it doesn &apos;t work , but we &apos;ve also learned a lot .
and then i took a satter and put it on .
we &apos;re going to see climate change as a serious threat to our business .
take a look at this , this is the same , clean coal technology .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the spatial thinking is intimately connected to how we understand a lot of our surroundings .
there are effects that can transform live , like hall and filters .
last month researcher economists argued that the whole continent now has an negative bottom rate .
they were always great , because the dancers were professional , and they were fantastic .
still , we &apos;re very , very willing to be an information campaign .
there &apos;s technical concepts like the augmented reality , which means the extended reality .
yes , kids are from nature , or should be curious , designers too .
and then it &apos;s been released by the ancient society , and the first form of abstraction .
and then the next generation in which we &apos;re actually more pro-speaking today .
frosty of the coal man is a great , happy burresses .
the theme of being close is the law of the continuity and so on .
why ? i put a whole book to try and explain myself .
we &apos;ve tried different approaches to simplify the minimum components .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s powered by seadragon .
i don &apos;t know exactly if i have time to show you other environments .
look at this as the legacy of the work of stephen lawler on virtual earth .
i want to start with what i call &quot; official dogma . &quot;
i had better . all of these choice allowed me to have better .
so no more zeroes and ones or cocktail code , but just a metaphor .
not the work itself . it was often as dark as ever and ever .
and i promised back to tell you what the machine works .
do you worry you &apos;re going to get rid of the humiliation of an abverse ?
and the answer -- the short answer to all these questions : namely .
and i was scared about more things that no one would cause .
in your cruise packs , john -- how are you going to do that ?
a second circle starts to be similar to similarities or arguing .
but you ask americans to say , &quot; the plant speaks to us . &quot;
you can also try to do that with words like revenge or profit or whatever .
and then string rocks so that they give them the kind of view .
you &apos;re basically learning to read before you just talk only a word .
you don &apos;t need to be able to make music anymore if you &apos;re getting bored .
so , you &apos;re not going to eat the food , just because you can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t have to bite classical music because they don &apos;t play an instrument .
so they &apos;re going to hear what you &apos;ve just imagined in the mind .
well , with the age of 10 , you have dreams , but they don &apos;t have any major memories .
you put a new idea in it and turn that answers with an reaction .
it &apos;s just that easy to realize that it has very different in mind .
even though i &apos;m at the fire fire , i &apos;m interested in pymaking things .
and now our fake consciousness immediately turns out that you can do something .
and that has to do that , we go back into the fourth century .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for charity , which is the prophet .
a lot of times the music class is that you only read the notes .
i was allowed to ask liraffaries if i could mention them .
and in our western world , we were always too stupid to take our nutrients back .
that is , we don &apos;t have to control the people as much bad .
so he doesn &apos;t want to think , it &apos;s a convenient way to do it .
because the phosphorus is frozen on the solid levels of layers .
traditionally , we think of environmental debate , we &apos;re too much on the world .
that means we &apos;re not too much , we &apos;re too stupid . yes ?
for example , we do this in china , for example , where we take the waste from this .
so there i was , as a designer , a lot more behavior than this .
i say to my own words , which could be written between this framework .
but if i ask you , how do you deal with your wife ?
so the baby is carbon positive for the whole life , already from the beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need to be nuclear neutral , we can be climate change .
as a symbol of a music player , i first started to get the written notes .
so , the music works as much as the spoken language of spoken language .
and these particles are water , as our cloud is a cloud of dots .
seven million people are on a set of currency or unconditional criminal .
i thought , &quot; yeah , grandmother . i promise it . &quot;
that we are all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
we want to eradicate lives for the lives of sophistication for kids .
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
we do that . so we are as much as we appreciate .
but think of a way that is integrated in our own lives .
it would be fair to us , consciously and restricting people . &quot;
and that &apos;s why we really don &apos;t really understand what our actions have in the historic context .
over the last three decades , the crime rate has escalated in america .
and i think we &apos;re going to help virtually why we &apos;re going to help any of them .
as a child , i had collections of stories , rocks , flirts and duries .
a story facing new issues , like the environmental crisis .
and with a method of recoding , analogous to reproduction . &quot;
but one of them likes to give up two numbers in the right order .
but if something like this is happening , it changes the qualitative conditions .
a citizens helped another citizen , but the government played a central role .
and he doesn &apos;t really have an idea . he starts with the animal overman .
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started discussing .
so he did what any good developer would do , he wrote an app .
this is the fact that we &apos;re going to have a lot in context with increasing attacks .
and even more than he walked out of the door , he showed himself .
and then my worst moments : how did i make a dumb mistake ?
green is one , blue is electricity , pink is input and orange is wires .
these are the questions that we need to spend the next 50 years .
they use online attacks to earn a lot of money , a huge amount of money .
you may think that he was fined , but it &apos;s not true .
in the united states , the institute of medicine is the number of 100,000 .
in an emergency time , i have two times a blind controller .
&quot; do you remind yourself to the patient with a shower ? &quot;
and my little startup wants us to make the environment by making it ...
bin death takes a heightened risk risk with it .
&quot; do you remember the patient who rode her home ? &quot;
the rest of the day i had this nagging feeling in my stomach .
we are closer to the seasonal and move us towards the world championship .
these people represent more trillion dollars dollars going down into the global economy .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
scarcity is a converbs , and technology is a resource of the rich force .
and also , despite her logarithmic label on the left , it &apos;s coming up .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant .
so we decided , tony -- t -- and to support his thing .
they were there in february , and it &apos;s been a lot more comfortable .
despite that warning , i knew that anybody would buy the lottery right .
thank you for having us fed us a fear of fear . thank you .
tell me about the &quot; why . &quot; and what does it give us ?
and so i found a company called olson zvalman in pittsburgh .
japanese selval &apos; val meets skb7 , except the washing day .
but if it comes , it &apos;s going to be implemented , it changes something .
our politicians say it &apos;s our president , it says , even our ceos say it .
but is it a tough thing because of the film or a difficult thing for me ?
so this is the whole concept , the film , from the beginning to the end .
i went into the way , and i slowly noticed , that these kids actually suggested something .
how do we develop that intuition ? well , we love playing with things .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals are not in the middle east .
and in fact , this false set of data is recorded by stuxnet before .
and i was thinking about the relationship with my wife , to friends .
the pilot had actually moved the machine , and we weren &apos;t so far away .
imagine a great explosion , as you get on a thousand feet .
she saved my life by using me to use the toilet in the nurses .
and i always say to people that i don &apos;t want to come with me like a scientist .
what is the mailing ? what puppes do is they &apos;re right now ?
and someone who has an art potential , deserves so much more .
this is the adloch , in the multipligia .
rebecca kiks : &quot; friday . &quot; is one of the most popular videos in the year .
so , because you &apos;re doing that , if you &apos;re called yosemite mountain .
photos where you have to think of a moment for a moment to figure up the trick .
because of course , that &apos;s an image you can &apos;t see with your camera .
now i &apos;d like to have my own kids , and i still think that &apos;s the boat .
when there is a band in our family , it &apos;s through the women .
we told their stories and insurance , and they were told that we were still at theirs .
a school uniform to the buttons , because she had to reach six years .
just like the double rainbow , it seems like it doesn &apos;t seem to be .
it &apos;s not about what is realistic , but what we think is realistic .
but they didn &apos;t need to be able to describe the large mundane objects around us .
so let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : the purchase of a car .
well , before we &apos;ve gone lunch today , i had a conversation with a professor .
they make more poorer decisions -- worse financial and worse medical decisions .
just about 12 percent of their own choices required for an hour or more of their time .
on february of february , it became 114 to a voice .
so , in december , we met in the room of a hotels in miami .
so i did this thing in a similar way to make a computer chip .
you can put a wall in between , and you can create a little diwer .
it took about 90 percent of birds , which are a lot of birds .
at the moment , it was as if a movie director had had to change .
we were only about five people at the time to rebuild the society .
that is , we were looking for the largest battery in the world .
now , a runner is simply going to run the power station to keep the frequency .
and the reality of that term gives us all of us , and moves , inspired and supported .
what nathaniel went on , he took the music back into a community of friends .
and the title of the presentation was , you know , you can get a hundred percent renewable renewable .
and i brought you a project that i want to introduce you to now .
well last year , there were 72 birds on this site , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s the largest and one of the most important private bird reserves in all of europe .
he said , &quot; no . you do it because the food is better . &quot;
she tasted sweet and pure , as if you &apos;d take a bite from the ocean .
it has evolved over evolution in the course of evolution , in fact . &quot;
that &apos;s the equivalent of 100 nuclear power stations , because it &apos;s very fast everywhere .
i want to take this idea a little further with something a little bit more crazy .
and because i &apos;m at the fire fire , i &apos;m interested in submersibles .
but we know that if we say that , social systems are very sensitive .
that &apos;s why composers rely on us , reinventing the pieces again .
they can make them less , yes , retested or giving them a fall .
this woman then complained then , the portrait would not look like that .
and there is this story from the woman of the bison for worchester .
why do we need to prevent people from doing something if it &apos;s true ?
the summary is a short line and a symbol of the area that comes from it .
you don &apos;t have to call that , that &apos;s a little bit more politically incorrect .
it &apos;s impossible to work in a society that should work .
so we should see them as something that is inherently true for our life .
they say who doesn &apos;t have a soul , which is dead and can &apos;t say .
this is where this logic comes from this , yes , in this deceptivation talk to expression .
in fact , you have to be able to see whether there &apos;s something like sacfree freedom .
and then he added , &quot; but our water did not have any inherent . &quot;
all right , there &apos;s presto right there , this is a fast piece .
i think we can power this world with energy that doesn &apos;t heat the same time .
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be chez panisse , but it would be nice .
you might ask : why would somebody actually spend time to create a marshmallow challenge ?
and what the marshmallow challenge is , it helps them identify types of assumptions .
and those of you who are interested in can visit us can go back to me .
they find mad messages from all around the world , and we release it out .
it &apos;s because the opportunity on this planet don &apos;t go back .
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re wiggling , and they &apos;re really coiled .
his new macho is now : &quot; why is it not going to work on research ? &quot;
but this is not really about this , and then i open my hand .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a scientist , and it was an amazing thing to me .
and if you want to have the ultimate tutoring effect , you have to grab on a needle .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not in the belid .
you can see it in the same way , but you can also take away if you want .
it &apos;s incredible . you can see , you know , this team will win . &quot;
there &apos;s going to be on the defoundworld , but also in the landscape , right ?
i have all these movies , these documentary films , for a very small audience .
well , we put a lot of carbon dioxide every year , over 26 billion tons of tons .
right now , in this world , we think that data are a curch .
and , instead of moving around , we can get away from this .
and then when i was a profession , it was the filmmaking .
what we did was documentary films , but actually science science .
because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ?
and i can do anything i &apos;ve been looking at today .
in your mind , timeline and probability is really going to go to your life ?
that includes all the food we eat , clothes , tv , heating .
normally there are no deadline that you need a miracle to a specific date .
let &apos;s first look at burn fossil fuel , burning from either coal or natural gas .
if you want to do it by 100 percent , you need an incredible wonder .
instead of breaking over your head , you just burn it . it &apos;s a great thing .
but even if you turn this kind of data , there &apos;s still some technical fusion .
in 1957 , both of the bita can record , and made a hard mistake .
and i said , you need to have it as long as you &apos;re talking about .
does it allow the chemistry to make these really large molecules done , which has never been done before ?
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
and the merchant said , &quot; do you like to calm up , easy , or hell ?
when they came to 100 species , one of them should have been perfect .
and this leads to less satisfaction with the results , even though results are good .
they &apos;re never going to be pleasant , because your expectations , my expectations , are high .
and so we started with the question , can we engineer a chromosome ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment , or they did the wrong salc .
you want to really get the decision right when it &apos;s home for all the time , right ?
so 12 to 24 hours later , it &apos;s reformed as it was .
there are enzymes that are called the restriction enzyme that actually embody dna .
we are about six to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
so here &apos;s a spectacular picture from the atlas in the field that you see with you .
these wires are called 13a thousand open-legged , if the machine goes up to high-performance .
what could be better ? &quot; damn the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
i think that this is going to be able to print our artists for the last 500 years .
and rick szeliliski was done , a very good collaboration .
. you know , i &apos;ve never believed that i will never be going to work at microsoft .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
his uncle , with its holdness in the diaspora , brought people to nepal .
his mother was imprisoned when punishment for -- for the crime .
the man &apos;s grandfather was not frightened in front of the arctic night or the driver &apos;s storm .
this is a banal case . this is a copy from the guardian .
now today , in some different lakes , in alaska , there are methane from itself from the water .
one effect , it &apos;s more powerful , is because it &apos;s going to free it .
we have now an infinite selection of telephones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less intelligent , not because they &apos;re less carefully .
should i marry ? should i have kids to have kids , or do i have a career ? &quot;
and in fact , you should do that . these are important questions .
we all know what &apos;s good about this , so i &apos;m going to talk about that .
the greeks sent these truth spirits to creativity .
the interesting thing is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural nature .
and once a interface , which is more intuitive and very much natural .
we could only absorb as an orphan moller through the ocean ocean .
this is the pressure of pressure and print writing with a guberg and others .
many use the word , knowledge don &apos;t know what it means .
it sounds very detailed , but it &apos;s all exciting when you &apos;re concerned about it .
and then it goes back to the back , and then it &apos;s actually just happening .
the next generation of representation is working on a lot more with behavior .
you can explain that much better because there &apos;s more work behind that .
why don &apos;t we sing , not to come from the top of a to b ?
that means all of our intelligence means that we want to be fat than trees .
you were invited to eat them for food , not to make food .
that is , you can see the internet , you can get rid of the internet .
we say people , oh yes , you have no environmental awareness in the south .
and it creates seeds of rare plants , so they &apos;re contributing by the throw to biodiversity .
the primary medium was the language , something very comfortable , something very comfortable .
a television machine , or a washing machine that uses it just to use .
it &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide how to evolve .
and i &apos;m going to lay up the filter with the bass , for a bit more expression .
so these dstroies in the world lead to a dramatic increase in fire .
four times as many in the last 30 years , as in the previous 78 .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it is .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge , and our challenge of national security .
there &apos;s an old african verb , &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone .
at the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest ice mass on the planet .
i brought you an example of the north american stem of the nootca of native indian .
so it was a curiosity , and i was sort of going into the matter of matter , like this .
so , you know , so , you know , now , to hack biology , you need some materials .
but always the approach is that it should be easy and accessible .
and a project that i started in a project recently was to build a gene gun .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically convenient .
now we &apos;re actually in the same kind of situation that we &apos;ve done with the arrow .
i think the big picture makes sense when you divide it in a couple more billion steps .
your skin cells are impossible without heart cells , muscle cells , cell cells and so on .
where you usually get out of your town in your town in 311 .
but in &quot; the &quot; better connect &quot; is public in public , so everyone can see it .
this is a generation that grew up to see her voice for granted .
they use their hands to write applications that improve government &apos;s work .
we choose to work every year , and we &apos;re going to work with 60,000 species .
and these cells -- that &apos;s what these cells -- they made them happy for another billion years .
no one knew where the nearest life was going to be in this moment .
and it &apos;s partly making the techniques that we don &apos;t even understand .
so when i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
we know that a business process isn &apos;t optimal when it becomes too complicated .
so you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can post online .
but what they really do is to show what is possible with technology today .
i spend most of my time working with people living in prison , prison or death cells .
we don &apos;t decide to decide , even though it comes to our best interests .
now these decisions are different in the number of choices they offer a decision .
to become part of the constitution , it needs to be approved by congress .
so if you really think about it , it &apos;s where we are today .
and we decided to do an experiment , and we chose marh-wire for our experiment .
we set up a little bit of cheating right at the entrance of the shop .
she was something that made that you &apos;d always want to be close .
the categories must tell you something , not the one that gives the selection .
i looked through the duping wall , and i was watching it .
jimmy &apos;s bucked the tweet that the video was so popular .
imagine the first piece : a man who &apos;s burning his life piece .
like most adults on the boat , my mother did a little toxic bottle .
by the end of the day , i served a huge soup soup that we shared .
there are a variety of ways to connect the world and technology .
what would your mind deal with that your body is in the room ?
she was born in 1880 , and the experience of slavery shaped very strong .
because i experienced it when i was in 1971 , i studied a lagoon in west africa .
and over time , there &apos;s no fish left there , and we think that &apos;s value .
and after two , three days , it was clear that she would never fall again .
why didn &apos;t i ask the high doctor ? why was i waving them home ?
and he got franvenic antibotica , and then a few days later .
it &apos;s almost an ideological reaction like antibodies that attack a human attack .
but now the biggest force that will lead us to a world of excess .
i went there because i was growing up in europe , and i wanted to work in africa .
and if we have a power of energy , we will also have water on abundance .
this is wlalos hitchore from baking in estonia .
these are matthew anderson , bread evolutionary dadaus and so on and so on .
mr. jaen himself is free foot , which is not unknown .
it may seem strange to you , but i &apos;m a big fan of concrete block .
and it &apos;s now hundreds of thousands of people played the game online .
and so they wrote this observation , and we called them the theory of quantum mechanics .
you can also think about it in terms of how we see our identity .
vaclav hael , the great checese politicians , once said .
i had something , your sister had something . go , drink a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want . don &apos;t get your mind .
he said , &quot; grandma tells everybody that they are special . &quot;
and she believed that this was the subjects that we should care about .
then she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to give me three things , bryan . &quot;
i talk about race and the question whether we &apos;re right to kill the right .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks it &apos;s always worse .
we have to have some ways to confront that challenge : these problems , that suffering .
and i didn &apos;t only have written to my shock , but also sent to the court .
and yet , forty-five percent of all the deadholders are not with a screctiance .
four : malignant , diamonds . 5 : dangerous , ok , bitships .
in the summer of 2009 , robbie marshall was under a severe disclaff .
and they say , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t seen this right . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
use them in a network store , they drink a park in the neighborhood .
it means to produce something that is in one , the potential out of the potential .
or maybe they &apos;re one of those who have been around for more creativity .
we draw from a shared ancestor to modern chimpanzees , about six or eight million years ago .
in that period , there were probably 20 or 25 different strains of hominids .
we can also give a new meaning to that , which is going out of severe times .
so let me introduce you to what you think about , or the human universal dawn .
this supercomputer is called the global ancestor system , of course .
this could be the evolutionary origin of &quot; , &quot; it puts him at the eggs . &quot;
the founding fathers were out of my view of the original anatomical activists , which is that .
and part of that , they made us a concept of anatomical concepts .
and i want to say , &quot; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
wiwities are change for change that we haven &apos;t explored yet .
underpants for exactly a week , everything i &apos;ve done in my suitcase .
in the spirit of the other self , remember self , they get another story .
if you &apos;re not a players , you might have some of the motives in this picture .
now , remember that self-self is more than remembering and telling stories .
this is one of the explanations that &apos;s been given to the dominance of memory .
there are actually two concepts from happiness that we can use , one per self .
when you ask yourself , if you ask yourself , it &apos;s a very different thing .
what &apos;s interesting today is that the real-time control systems are starting to emerge in our lives .
some of you may be thinking , &quot; this is a lot of time for games . &quot;
we imagine epic theory and we give people the opportunity to reach them .
oh , you know that . ok . so we &apos;ve got some players here .
why is it impossible to think , you couldn &apos;t just do everything ?
here &apos;s the four things i found . first of all , push optimism .
and players are always ready , worked hard when they get the right job .
feminism is about stereotypes about gender , so feminism is not a female female .
and then he added , really , quite emotional , that &apos;s the whole experience .
and if the car and the driver and the driver would be good enough then they won the race .
do you have something a little bit quiet , fet-sized , conservative ?
i think if you prevent people from it , you get them closer .
there &apos;s only one and these are the united states -- fortunately , fortunately .
and i would be happy if ceg was going to help this happen .
now , i can answer all of your questions and give you an extra socket .
what about me ? what about the drugging hid ?
it has nothing to do with centrifuge , with uranium .
are they established , traditionally , healthier , protections , a compassionate force like oprah ?
the gray box is the gray box , and on the top you see the centriues .
i feel like we need to encourage people to take risks .
i think my personal view is very easy to explain with this slide and their access .
i actually come to one of my favorites , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
this is a representation of her brain . your brain can be split in two percent .
in my opinion , the moses is sad , but the driving force is not israel .
he was still a little kid , and not very good at it , and he was constantly drifting .
imagine that everybody can give a little donation for an image .
they say that all of the things that are displayed up there is a life life .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the energy consumption -- electricity to 80 percent of the co2 emissions .
you can see the colobseum , the floods .
with this information , we realized that there is a lot of inefficiencies in the system .
on the left-hand side , you see the imagery points , which are different .
our cities have become , in the last few years , just with networks and electronics .
i said , &quot; very archaan , how can that be ? &quot;
because if the wine is far here and the person is there , i open it .
we have a series of projects for a wall of the parking place in front of the hospital .
so we &apos;re looking at how to do it better , faster and stronger .
and you know , this part of life takes everything that needs the rest of life .
well , i had a unique space that day ; i was sitting on 11-d .
so here , we can see here , film , paper and water bottles , like georgia .
you put it on , return to the diseases coming back , horrible diseases , and this is happening .
and just a little bit through my skin and on the other side .
i don &apos;t want to go to the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m a adventurer .
they don &apos;t really have their own facts . &apos; bye , they don &apos;t have .
okay , so there &apos;s reasons , and i think we know what the reasons are .
in this country not at all , but 160,000 times in the world last year .
he can save the lives of 35 , 500,000 children a year in the developing world .
a big machine , a cool , scientist type machine , and this is a time machine .
so there are deep modern lessons for us , about nature &apos;s nature and success .
sorry . if you get bad , look away , don &apos;t look at it .
and it really starts with a fundamental reaction to our memories -- it starts immediately .
well , this is a direct state between the living self and the deliberate self .
just to give you a sense of the correlation that is more about five .
i calculated that the invention of the time is 21 billion hours of time a week .
i &apos;m convinced you &apos;re somehow drawn to the thgia .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re more likely to see this face in real life when we face hard problems .
is there a natural demo , a demonstration , which is the idea of the human being ?
i remember this last year , when i took mosquitos and somehow liked it .
and the preparation involved has been enormous . we had to build cameras and windows and all kinds of things .
it &apos;s actually just that , but my mind is within the front of the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically within the mac of the titanic .
i asked the top scientists to say , &quot; do we really have to go down to near zero ?
in this case , we have to give up internal gas and get a miracle in very short time .
this is me , as i am in life , i &apos;m doing bad face .
what you might ask is , how does this come ? why is that ? what is with those ?
i think here in the ted group there are many people who have been involved there .
nathan myhrvold , and i &apos;m going to finance a company , maybe surprisingly , to follow the nuclear approach .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese did something in the direction .
do we need to have emergency applications to try and maintain the earth &apos;s body stable ?
you talk about it , you think about how it &apos;s going to look , it &apos;s the power .
he wanted to capture the feelings playing with play , so he made a camera .
in my high school , i was driving the bus to school every day .
so let &apos;s go back to these two creatures that have been labeled at the beginning of the talk .
i get all my clothes in a second hand on hhmarkets , and in dehand .
women , like men , have something in our bodies that you call adrenaline units .
and the headlit represent represent the hairs that vililites are .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- no one didn &apos;t mean something .
our ancestors had never been that hard to fight the question when someone was dead .
they didn &apos;t think about that , but what they did for us was fantastic .
for us , and it &apos;s fundamental to us in the game of relationships and the care of tolerance .
one of the things that was consistent with is someone had a pair of shoes .
if you think you &apos;re going to see something good , it &apos;s almost certain .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden pailds , at everything .
in fact , over the cities , all of that view and input into objects of your daily life .
well , all of our objects , our environment , come back to us .
now , i should tell you what one night happened when all the sensors go to work .
first of all , a balloon game -- and i don &apos;t think in the football .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i &apos;ve ever been .
we &apos;re working with universities across sub-saharan africa , and shop , social reforming .
it &apos;s what we think about the people we think about these words .
players like it to be part of awe and resociative missions .
the second largest largest in the world , with nearly 80,000 prescriptions is the world of warcraft .
and then on the next day you &apos;d play . and the next day you &apos;d eat .
they played a box game , and they were going to break up a epic adventure .
and so scientists came to the idea that hertic denus is actually true .
and i &apos;ve seen some things that make epic theory in online worlds as possible .
they are , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
so , what do we want to add -- one of the disabled people or a powerful person ?
and i don &apos;t want to get the impact or the maximum force of the death of a person .
and he called this part of his place the x factor , the potential of the human will .
the real meaning of the word &quot; lux &quot; in the word &quot; is in the word &quot; sentence . &quot;
so we went in &quot; terminator two , &quot; my next film , even further .
as any of you were born in this room were spoken on earth .
you get a sense of the themes that are going to be the most popular ones .
and what are our values and what are our values and what are our target ?
and you have to do it and understand it and understand it .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their weight water from this frozen water .
it &apos;s in skin and abundance in america , and it helps our economy to grow .
if you &apos;re in a crystal line , you &apos;ll find that too , and you can get a little bit nervous .
by giving the sictiers , and they can put them side-by-side , he can interact the characters .
and then there &apos;s do-it-yourself yourself , and then there &apos;s a do-it-yourself mirror .
in a sense , the arctic ice ice is the beating heart of our global climate system .
and , if that &apos;s true -- and i think it &apos;s right -- is the question .
and i think that &apos;s where i think there are fewer people who are there .
and i would invite everybody to engage with this , and also try to do something .
the fourth point is that the story for us is a place of information .
it sounds very , very rough , and it sounds like science fiction , i know .
when professors are becoming curious , they &apos;re often going to break into the n of research .
and one reason is , this enormous reservoir is warming beneath the north .
it is that we know globally and more and better and better and better climbing .
with 100 different types of jeans in the windows , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
actually , it took me several years with a biological review before we did the first experiments .
whether he &apos;s a place of a mind or a bunch of desm is irrelevant .
and it &apos;s humbling to think that our species may have existed for over the past six years .
their own photos are covered with metadata , which has a different person .
the doctor says a &quot; has these benefits and risk and b has these benefits and risks .
he does a point about now alive , and maybe doing things slowly .
because steve jobs said , you need to be careful to cover the money .
but that &apos;s the way we &apos;re working at the process of developing vaccine materials .
the viral particles were then released by the cells , and then killing e. e. , and killing e. e. .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even see it with the light microscope .
the chromosome that &apos;s been in the cell was no ; the chromosomes that we put down .
then , of course , there &apos;s all the co2 from this material that goes into the atmosphere .
we &apos;re right here at the limits of biological reality and in those of us .
but suzztes took this script as the primary medium , got up .
but what makes santa so interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
people always ask me , what do you do here in adpentle?
we &apos;re cheaper than the diesel system , if the diesel cost five percent a year .
so here &apos;s necessary to do what we understand under fcorrectness , again .
and if it &apos;s true , then we need to prevent that people get knowledge of it .
so the second sentence is that if it &apos;s right , it doesn &apos;t have a soul .
the buridanan esel is a esel , which is made of pure nature .
so , in the kind of shifting in the climate &apos;s shift , you see the greatest power of the lie .
on such a lie , you can see the liars themselves don &apos;t believe what he says .
or what i &apos;m going to consider today is because what you might have thought about .
the day before the event , i called the ceo of public work for the company .
no , not because i &apos;m a self-intenctable and good human .
instead of throwing the water out they use the channels to pull the water back .
oh , and by the way , these twinch are not even there .
i had a sort of a journey of the penguins , so i looked at myself .
you need this lie to maintain a living arm to keep a self-portrait .
in order to do that , don &apos;t look at the agricultural economy model for the future .
in holland , that &apos;s easier , because in holland , this is the land built on flowers .
now , for me , the composers , and what you might have now meant for him today .
there &apos;s a bond functions where i know exactly where i have to reach .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a bit less harmful .
that is , we &apos;re losing about five thousand times more than new .
in israel , you say , if you help a human party , you save the earth .
we are losing three million tons of phosphorus every year that really need to go back into layers .
so we have the eyes at the front , and now we think we &apos;re going to see from the back .
by beethoven , you know he heard more than he had already been hearing .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but it &apos;s at different time time , with different light .
every one of your own music is going to be fixed by the outside with music .
or c , because you agreed to be uncontrollable .
you &apos;ve got a second -- or third opinion , how do you say it today ?
i answer , but surely you can say whether you like it or not .
please watch the form of the iceberg , and where it &apos;s on the water line .
when i met it as a young boy , she came up to me and she took me .
in another chapter , you have to highlight a piece of building a box and tag .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there was this willingness , but not in this country .
and yet , in our country , there is an dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
they say , &quot; no . tell people that we grew up with this . &quot;
here in alabama today , 34 percent of the male black people are lost their vote .
in the socially weak and black parts of the population , despair and hopelessness , because of its changes .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? well drink but what . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
and it was so clear that i couldn &apos;t breathe , and then they let me go .
he said , &quot; mr. stedoson , did you hire this crazy geek ? &quot;
and so this speaker is going to try to invest the money into more security signs and safety .
and so -- here &apos;s &quot; this box is heard ... &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t write my name .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver bag .
it gets faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems to be so puzzling .
now , all of the left remains left the numbers at the best .
so we put a evolutionary process in the machine , which is going on in the microsecond area .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , the hundreds of millions of millions of years .
i have a very complicated , unreasonable and confused idea in my head .
so , as an example , the most sophisticated we knew was the human language , the human language .
if someone takes something that doesn &apos;t hear him , it &apos;s not just a thief .
so the neurons are the process of information processing that &apos;s built this cell community .
he kept looking through the window and he could hear the whole topiriyay .
and he knew it , he was able to guide additional information to her .
and over a year to two hours , she started to feel better .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , nice bridges or beautiful buildings .
and the color notes , you might remember , &quot; avatar , &quot; avatar . &quot;
within a year , you have a survey , and then starts with the commercial fishing fisheries .
90 percent of our own ones were failing , other animals , who are associated with the bottom .
in the &apos; 70s -- in the &apos; 70s , europe had a lot of development projects .
the second story is going to be a different concept that is transformative , asserable .
and you know the murder of people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
and my patients aren &apos;t cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms in the same way .
i don &apos;t know if you knew this , but bacteria can actually replace their dna .
every second every second , every single day , our senses will catch much more information than our brain can ever get .
i gave her up . i gave her medicine to take the pressure of the heart .
at that point , i was the cardiological layer in cardiological service .
i think we need to do something about a change of a change of medicine .
and instead of economic gridlock , i see one of the biggest economic interest of history .
this is the story of napoleon iii in the middle of the 18th century .
how many of you have seen the victory of ibm supercomputer at risk ?
and the old saying , &quot; when it bites blood , the demand is very true .
so when we see the news , we prefer to look at negative innovation .
what happened after that is that individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other .
but on the coolest thing i &apos;ve ever worked , it was about this guy .
if dan were a brand , he would probably be a classic mercedes of flying rio .
how can we keep them fresh -- better fresh , more fresh times .
what does it mean for an object at the same time , and not vibrating ?
and what only happened when you want to see like van gogh &apos;s masterpiece ?
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion points ? &quot;
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
when i went to visit and visit these museums , i started to learn a lot .
we have to encourage people to be afraid of possibilities that you might feel scared .
and i think some of the companies will only focus on a strength , rather than both of them .
do you have to be afraid . in what kind of rollercoaster is ?
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of hercal tavio sent the link to the tedtalk .
and when your employees can &apos;t keep them apart , they can &apos;t do it . &quot;
as you talk about the smaller movies , we are as challenging as a brand .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so , for example , he works exactly as well -- in a power station or in a car factory .
the idea here is obviously not just the machine machine &apos;s machine controls .
these gray boxes are not running with windows software ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
and more than anything else , they &apos;re the best parents you just can be ?
i want to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned that day about me that day .
i could see it in her eyes , and it was horror , life was too end .
now this may seem silly to you , if you &apos;ve never been thinking about new cities .
you can have me as a farmer , or in leather , but no one has ever been tow .
you know , the average superconducting today , today gives you 55,000 products .
instead of sending them into the third world , we send them into rathability .
now -- we can just jump this -- i &apos;m just going to jump out the video ...
because the transition seems to be very , very confusing , when you &apos;re in the inside .
it &apos;s not possible that everything lasts forever and forever as now .
you can have their opinion , on every channel at any time , and they do it .
if we want this institution to work for us , we need to make bureaucracy sexy .
and most people understand this , but they think that one is the input of the other .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is building into this .
this is work very smart to work in the new urban office in boston .
it &apos;s probably the slightest largest apps that &apos;s written in the last year .
i think the reason for that is that we realize something happening .
and you see this problem often when you look at the long lists all the way across all of these funds .
we know exactly where all the atm machines are sitting around .
but if i could give this , and you could get it safely , i would do it .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , prior to business .
they would sort of find the time to do english and job skills .
as i said , one of the biggest stars -- justin bieber -- did it start with youtube .
who would predict the double rainbow or d black or &quot; nyan cat . &quot;
what &apos;s important is that creativity , which is in the network culture culture of technology and stuff .
now , what i &apos;m doing now is i change the order in the decisions .
you can go on to the website , all the design stores and make it yourself .
a year ago or something , i read a study that really blew me up .
this creates a very strong picture in the head . that &apos;s a lot more powerful than a white pill .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be right , but almost never the same is the same .
when paul talks in a public concern , he can &apos;t tell you without armed guards .
i know they did this because half the americans do it every day .
it doesn &apos;t have any nutrients , it doesn &apos;t have any protein , and it &apos;s going to study it .
i personally learned him from the cub scout of the peaco .
and not only that , we used our imagination to disrupt this world .
but it &apos;s not about people like us , because this is a greater thing than that .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future .
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments of the life self ?
but danny , all of the american effort is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
in the united states , in the united states , to measure the experience happiness of the population .
this is going to be a two decades of national statistics , i think , or two decades of national statistics .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept on .
these emotions have never been , if we play games , they don &apos;t just exist .
now , efficiency , the e , the energy per service , has finally got good news .
so what we have to do on a global level is to create a new system .
so i moved this other thing , and i made this other movie about the big ship .
sounds crazy . but it goes back to that that your imagination can create a reality .
we took little robots that we built , which was a fiber glass cable .
but at the end it ended out that i took space scientists into the deep sea .
so let &apos;s look at each aspect and think about how we get it to zero .
the reason for this is that there &apos;s a lot of trust to play with someone .
if somebody had built a 2.- inch construction , he carried the price home .
so i decided that &apos;s going to be the free contribution to the environment here .
well , there are all sorts of playful solutions like this , but they don &apos;t get much .
so three really difficult problems that might be solved , and that &apos;s why you should work .
and it would be the best if there &apos;s multiple , because then you could use a mixture .
then you invest a little time in planning and organization . they swarm and throw spaghetti sauce .
but in fact , my research on the institute of the future , the way for the future is literally complete .
according to arthur clarke &apos; law are more advanced technology and magic from each other .
i love this picture , because it &apos;s a room of somebody else , and that &apos;s his room .
so , i write for kids , and i &apos;m probably probably most of the most common children &apos;s children .
now , you could think that the whole thing would be in categories like me would be really happy .
so we have this continuous anatomic categories that are in many ways , resolve and fragmented .
and if you think that you don &apos;t look good in something , you probably have it right .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of our environment and power .
now the first project i want to show you is actually one of the first first of our labs in our labs .
i &apos;ve just come back from a community that knows the secret of humanity &apos;s law .
in home in new york , i &apos;m the ceo of a nonprofit organization called robin hood .
i &apos;m not trying to have that , right ; i choose to be happy .
while we diminished , i had this sense of dying to dying .
and it seemed something to say , with these gray boxes , this real-time and control systems .
and i want to tell you how we were able to become smart from this code .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that others could be met from student web .
i &apos;ve been working with people with dwarfisid -- so people who were smaller than common .
certainly i would never leave a alien world with a spaceship , which seemed quite unlikely .
you can &apos;t order enough to be about how key this factor is for the quality of the human &apos;s quality of human beings .
and that &apos;s what happened because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs , not despite that experiences .
nobody wants to change their life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
it &apos;s about the values that put in these words , and how we build these values .
so we have to look beyond the patology and focus on all the field of human possibilities .
and i turn around and i see these older man . i had no idea who he is .
when i first saw her , i brought it out of her mother &apos;s belly . &quot;
we know that we work as human beings , if we do hard , great work .
let &apos;s start looking at reality that people today , in some cultures , are making decisions about their offspring .
they call this in the &quot; eureka trials in the united states , we call it &quot; tracking . &quot;
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s a very comfortable thing .
and you &apos;re going to protect you all and you can only provide you all .
they &apos;re helping digestion from essential nutrients , and they protect it against certain diseases .
but at the time , as multi-ellular organisms came out , things began to change .
and i thought , &quot; wow , this must be used in the movie art . &quot;
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique inflection issue of song , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
until today , i feel strangely amazed with what i see on my dive .
and the people are an example of a new generation of aid using manipulation digital data .
in fact , the archic models is that we have basically natural relation to the virtual imagination .
but , if it is writing , i &apos;ve been talking about it recently and i ask myself , why ?
that is -- look , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
maybe an ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of creative walks .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pencil . he doesn &apos;t have a casgrapher .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that -- you know what the hell then .
it lives in the deep sea , about a mile and a half miles deep , almost boiling water temperatures .
so we have the ability to build a big robot of billions of chromosomes a day .
the interesting thing is that at that time , at that time , the media producer and media was itself .
it &apos;s about virtuality , it &apos;s about non-linearity , it &apos;s about thorium .
all of this needs the ability to accept the basic ability to accept virtuality as a real habitat .
it &apos;s important for the designers who have the great semester , the great role laws .
that is , this first impression is going on in a basking rapid speed , as we see things .
and i think that &apos;s going to be changed by putting together all vaccines in it .
and that &apos;s a human being for us humans , if i have to think very little about it .
the only true choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , not what they did after .
i teach very wonderful creative students , and i give them 20 percent less work than i used to .
we use this great euphemism , trying and error , which has found itself .
the family , the fear for his life , took him all the weapons and all the tools .
what we finally have at national geographic is that we believe that politicians will never achieve something .
this is a project called photosynth , which is really two different technologies .
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
witness : now i &apos;m interacting with the object , and i can zoom out , zoom in , zoom in .
now i &apos;ve been saying that this is not the fault -- it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and that &apos;s what i want to say , there are some choices , but not everything was a choice .
if you break the goldfish glass , everything is possible , it &apos;s going to decrease happiness .
this was our first trial , starting with the digital information , the genome phi x 174 .
recently , i &apos;ve talked to the oil industry , and they said they felt this model .
think about it : we have a three-letter code : a , c , g and t. .
so that &apos;s all the more useful , but it &apos;s also a lot better .
it &apos;s a means with which the soul of a particular culture finds access to the physical world .
and if you &apos;ve got a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a stealth system .
and you really have to stay out of it , but i think it &apos;s going to be .
so , we pretend it &apos;s really impossible to be able to live without a soul .
because he &apos;s led it to a grapeshell he doesn &apos;t even exist .
and by the way , about a hundred gigawatt electrical power , about a hundred gigawatt power output .
and of course , you can only do that if you can be thrown in some way in any way .
we want to support , but we don &apos;t believe that you can solve the technical problem .
she came from school one day , she &apos;s a school , and she told her a student .
she heard about this book by charles darwin , the origin of species and the ancestry of man .
nathanian manan manstic anger transformed into understanding , in a dark curiosity and courage .
even better , he was in aquakulal after the worst of the most vulnerable standards of sustainability .
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve fished the ocean as we &apos;ve swmed forests .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t you go , &quot; don &apos;t we feed the chicken for fish ? &quot;
&quot; i know young , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
the third sentence that immediately comes up to people who have a strong sense of soul .
it &apos;s something between between , and we think it changes the way that information can be used .
so , it &apos;s about creating a big footprint that is going to be an wetlands .
and that &apos;s half of all the driving issues worldwide that will be caused through the textile industry .
for example , in low-stream , for example , for example , are 20 percent of the garbage .
that is , our whole intelligence means that we want to be fat than trees , right ?
and they &apos;re designed to do that through the design that a farmer can just exploit .
you see , there are two countries that are controlling almost 17 percent of phosphorus in the world .
at every point where you throw away , you &apos;re going to make life in life .
in the last 20 years , five thousand tons of uranium have been distributed in our fields in germany .
and the child plays , after a parsing , instead of a red flower , instead of a blue flower .
so no longer saving , avoid , reduce , no mission management , but smart waste .
it &apos;s totally alien for salmon , which we do with musicians with our music language .
so for the process of learning music language , you need to be at least as long as the previous language .
an example of it from a completely different area : rebecca has painted the barber x-lining .
but then , what i expect to do , because music is a beautiful , communicic thing .
we need digital security systems where a human machine machine can respond fast enough to respond enough enough .
sometimes when i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get their attention .
you have to make the sound of the wind ; they tear it up and read the rest of the book .
in this country , for children &apos;s lives for children &apos;s lives .
a policy policy of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
she said , &quot; first confession me to love your mom . &quot;
because in this context , we start to understand the real amazing things that make us feel .
as a physician , you can do good . as caring as caring as caring as caring as you can .
so steve pinker showed us that we are now living in a very peaceful time of human history .
i felt like our send watches , and the cameras were going to dream about it .
and i think we all here are part of the creation of what &apos;s going on next .
we &apos;re saying , &quot; computers , generated a lot of different million randomly by the dna sequences of ininstructions .
and because it is , there &apos;s a fundamental human dignity to respect the law .
and they developed special structures that do not do anything else as information within the organism .
when he saw me , he came over and he said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
found an article with a rad thought , so they could track the creators of that thought .
over time , we focus on the big animals and the seas are the big fish .
irinotar is a complete citizen board in the netherlands -- or was it .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- the protests , or by their audience .
the second largest street group that we see today aren &apos;t motivated by money .
this is really like , it means that we &apos;re right in a transition right now .
here , i think the art and the film may fill up the gap , and simulation .
this is why the dome of the laming-cent stimulus was made from aluminum to be made .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they cut the incidents .
and what it showed is that today , the human pattern tools are becoming better than the best superuse .
even though aluminum is 8.3 percent of the earth &apos;s population , it &apos;s not going to be as pure metal .
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explosion .
either wayles &quot; or &quot; hundreds of wind , &quot; they &apos;re going to have the choice .
i want to talk to you now what that might be , that transition that we are at the moment .
and it was also done a study with politicians in which they saw the ceos for a week .
you already have a building site ; they &apos;re already considering this area for the second city .
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how i want to close it .
and then we looked at what would be more like a glass of marxade .
and what they found is that an average ceo was busy doing 139 tasks in the week .
this chart shows how it looked like the video was popular last summer .
or even even trained from these cities , or hundreds of land around the world ?
already in the first seven days , there was a paroter for every single day .
and i &apos;ve come to the point that there is a new city that gives people new opportunities .
you hear a lot about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
and this is a great conceptual model of the world , as long as it doesn &apos;t exist .
here , for example , a study we did in a magazine magazine .
you put it up , are they something that takes blood in screens ?
michael j. nelson from the rise of science &apos;s science theater was a first one that made a joke on twitter .
if you know something about governance , you know it doesn &apos;t work that way .
we developed an app for andar , extended reality , to find these deleoes .
i &apos;m going to talk about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
it has an app , a web-and-and handmaster app , called &quot; killing &quot; . &quot;
they &apos;re frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t complain about it , fix them .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , but rather about generic form .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
she set up a computer store , and then he got a sitimotitraining and he got a business .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many of the time of this life projects are failing .
so to reach a realistic outcome , i think it &apos;s from me looking at planning .
you might think that this is just a landscape of landscape , and the bottom is manipulated .
and put this buzzer for a added effect , and you &apos;ve made a noise machine .
if you have 10 teams , which are typical , you get about six who have stable structures .
the challenge is a common experience , a common language or an equal , to build the right prototype .
when countries look in places like pends , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
this is the deadline that we &apos;ve done the environmental models that we need to be .
we don &apos;t just tell us peter , not just the highest towers , but the most interesting structures from all .
and that bwl students were trained to find the right plan , ok !
and this team , the curt and on work is going to improve the performance of the team .
one is energy density , which creates these technologies dramatically less than the power of power .
you &apos;ve told me that they don &apos;t bite . in fact they probably won &apos;t even leave the glass .
and the base lesson , i think , is that the construction is actually a connection of the arts .
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are successes of scientific method .
people are sitting in their belief and so tightly that you can &apos;t free it .
we &apos;re at a moment where we don &apos;t have the same relationship for progress as earlier .
echineea , a small antioxible , which helps you the jumps .
you can see that there &apos;s a kind of column , often known as &quot; mining wave reactor . &quot;
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this broken stuff , like diw .
no , not because we produce enough calories to feed the world more than just feed the world .
or better , how can we create conditions that enable every community to feed themselves ?
that is , 15 pounds of wild fish need to get a pound on a pound .
and that evening i was in bed , and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin and part of &quot; a crocodile . &quot;
and here , here he is looking for a pattern of appliances that remind him to the tanzics .
they do this because they can follow the &quot; white line of the street street .
so we also understand each other , i want to show you a fundamental , very simple magic trick .
for almost every manufacturing method , it &apos;s co2 today , except the renewables and nuclear energy .
capital , chemistry and machines at stake , and it never produced something really good for food .
i made my dive in a pool of plastic in the middle of the winter in buffalo , new york .
nature doesn &apos;t know frontiers , in contrast to our own , ignorant human imagination .
and i noticed how much this deep sea crossing , a space mission looked like this .
and this is how you see animals right next to a 500 degrees centigrade that they can survive there .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing and cold itself to us who can afford to .
robert gupta : i &apos;m going to play a little clip that i &apos;ve stolen .
our language expresses the social change , which has been triggered in many cases through a technological change .
he understood that the medical diagnosis , and how someone deals with it , two different things .
these are our master players . 500 million people who are extraordinarily good at something .
and in the next decade we have another billion players that are extraordinarily good at whatever .
so i started thinking about what it is to do what these games are going to do .
and dr. p. carried up very colorful , and was just designed to work with kids like this .
this is just one example of many of how adults can make the imagination of a child .
so , what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are the master player .
we &apos;re going to be so good at what we do , as the most important people in the world .
so if a mind is about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new type of individual forms .
now , when i was a marine ring at college , i had my first biology classes .
why not have the fast blood vessels that will enable you to run faster and longer ?
in the good , and early than you might think , these decisions are going to be on us .
but not only do that -- with merging and connect with the universe and other devices there .
because if we could figure that out , we &apos;ve never had competition of human potential .
i met mr. ayers in 2008 , two years ago , at walt disney cover hall .
so we have this reminder of ourselves , and the living self , and they &apos;re quite different .
it &apos;s about how pleasure or pleasure is the person when that person feels about their lives .
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both manipulin the idea of happiness .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much thought would these patients know they suffered ? &quot;
and none of these stories is very sophisticated or great -- but one of them is this clear ...
that will lead the patient , but only a little bit , much less than that .
nothing goes into my sleeve or comes out , no guitar . and you can study everything .
and maybe some of you have seen this new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; overflyer , read .
so in the last few years , we &apos;ve begun to learn about the happiness of two types of self .
is that something you can bring us to , because you have a few minutes left ?
people are realizing that they should think about happiness when they think about politics .
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to solve the most missing problems in the world .
you &apos;re not sitting around and spins , and there &apos;s always something very important to do .
so , it &apos;s going to be or bad aquakpiate , commercial , part of our future .
and this is an idea that , if you think about it , you can engage with hope .
he talked about invisible totators and smoke and about how somebody wanted to crack in sleep .
but in ancient greece and rome , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , okay ?
and that turns out that and it makes all of these inunable expectations of success .
when we sequenced the genome first in 1995 , the error rate had a 10,000 base pair pairs .
obviously , with a virus , it &apos;s very easy to deal with bacteria . it &apos;s much more complicated .
if we think about biological processes , or some process to replace that , it becomes a huge challenge .
the electronics industry had a dozen components and see the diversity of it .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch how they &apos;ll be taken in the next century .
so we had to develop a new way of doing these little bits and the error could correct .
we &apos;ve done it to about a hundred genes from the 500 or something that are here .
she felt if it came , because it would get the earth under its feet to the nurse .
but then i remembered how tom was talking in the free sky , and i tried .
so i took my view of the manuscript and i talked about my comment towards a blank corner of the room .
and i want to give you to publishing that i &apos;ve been today for my part of the jobs here .
as this happened , people knew what this was . they called it in his name .
we built small pieces , made a error error , and we had a dna molecule about about 5,000 letters .
and west antarctica , which showed over a few of the underwater islands is especially in the melt .
all of these photographs become interconnected , and it creates something bigger than the sum of the parts .
and what it does is it makes people walk on business and ask that question .
if i were to ask you , the great world expert , what would you say ?
so , indigenous ones are not sentimental , nor they &apos;re sent by the nostalgia .
the sister , who did this tabs , was brought into an educational camp .
and this is really what these ideas are looking at , to create these constraints for the available space .
we hope that this is not going to be a pop-up break and other nonsense -- that should not be necessary .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to free us out of this misable situation .
this is almost paralyzed to limited security -- possibly for the fish , definitely for us .
so with many options you can choose , people are very hard to decide at all .
i &apos;m going to give you another more exciting example of it , a study of investing in volunteers .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , tomorrow .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yorkers , i apologize .
so the things i &apos;m talking about is a strange issue of modern , rich , western societies .
what i &apos;ve got to say , if i &apos;m going crazy , is : don &apos;t worry .
and then you would suddenly see how it would be , if you could not speak your own language .
or d , you don &apos;t like music and want to have nix .
well , you see , no one doesn &apos;t have to be a viewing of all the open candidate .
the dutch government has explained to you , you &apos;re going to be the first country in the world .
we &apos;ve developed an ice scan , for example , which is liquid temperature .
this is the first ecological rucksack , actually , to go back into the cycle .
you &apos;re thinking in this time by looking at contemporary imagery , for example , and read literature .
now , i &apos;ve also been older than the jerry at age age , when he wrote the piece .
can i do that directly , or i need the manual manual or i need an assixalized training for it .
but this is an essential part of how you really want to explain things as well as very intuitive .
in the present , we have a very modern example that goes over and over and over again .
but it &apos;s not true , we have seven percent of europe , and our network is physical .
we just wanted to know what was going on with a normal , voky , chemical chemical battery .
here we see the wind again , again , again , all the way , single line .
does not be your fault , child play stuff , we have everything we &apos;ve done .
but that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to do again , when will things be more intuitive ?
then they just use what on the sun and the wind is there where they live .
and i &apos;m going to lay up the filter with the drums , so i can control the effect of global control .
i can make the whole sequence speed by putting the pace into one direction or the other direction .
here i am -- this is a fibonacci number , which i &apos;m going to do with a simple degree program .
an interesting thing about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
all you have to say is &quot; use it , &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
and you can put these sounds into the sequence that you can put into certain patterns .
and then finally , the effect effects of how savings and volume you use to use all of the sequence .
in short , a force is an interactive computer in the size of a cone .
this is a whole range of things that you &apos;re involved in as a designer .
so i don &apos;t have to plan it in the field , but it can improvise ; they go ahead or cheaper .
extremely important is already extremely important and much more important , and more importantly , in the future .
there &apos;s now craig venter in the united states trying to make glucose , which is gasoline from algae .
you mean , of course , we need biological materials , and you need tools , and that &apos;s a lab .
and our approach was to say , whoa , that you don &apos;t have to do this .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- rent injury , 30 percent of them -- chronic spinal ward injuries .
last year , we had a team of users in boston for the code for america .
and one of the things that we &apos;ve done , i want to share with you through a quick video .
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you actually made .
i was in the middle of the desert with a russian singer called a german photographer , ali .
it allows us to integrate things with a much higher complexity than the normal methods that allow us to produce .
then , the night steps , like speech and so forth , kept less than a million years .
the first steps of the story i told you about , a billion years per piece .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think i &apos;m going to happen in the way here .
this is because the government is like a growing ocean , and politics is the top 14-inch .
we can get them to do things that they thought they wouldn &apos;t .
but eventually , these realities will end up suffering from suffering , abuse , defense , inapartheid .
and when you do good recording , the result can be quite beautiful , and also quite realistic .
&quot; do it just say . &quot; she said . &quot; and not what you are not . &quot;
in one occasion , i was the classic east student , the relentless demands of himself himself .
at a time , my sister would have stopped my sister and i , you know , my grandmother .
the next piece of the project shows how a boat in the early light is just floating on sea .
now , tosh.zero he put it on , many blogs started writing on it .
it &apos;s going to be only a tiny percentage ever transplant , and it will look at thousands of times , and look at the cultural moment .
i &apos;m 4,000 years old , and i &apos;m afraid i &apos;ve never gotten a drop of alcohol .
the only thing i did is to change the order in which this information is going to be presented .
and it &apos;s exciting because i give my students african-american history , and i talk about slavery .
but before i leave the real theme of my presentation , let &apos;s start with a little bit of baseball .
so what can three billion growing growing , healthy , educated , invasive members of the human community ?
so here &apos;s an example of a project that they did , a movement of superpowered power .
how does it deal with the arab spring and the things that happened in egypt ?
for example , this is mr. dimitry golcecht from the kiev .
we fit our standards with the new level and we don &apos;t call ourselves in mind what was there .
as you can see , the lagon &apos;s palms , and you &apos;ve lost a bunch of trees .
and i got a bad sunfired , and i was convinced that i wasn &apos;t really about that .
the unhealthy way i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes one in the mind .
on the left side , jazz and one on the right is skydiving , but you know what ?
but finally , i decided to say my god , i have to go to court and crazy case .
three billion new minds , of whom we &apos;ve never heard of , will join global communications .
and to win , the device has to diagnose a better diagnosis than a team of skilled physicians .
aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and plattin .
think about it , a group of students today can affect the lives of billions of people .
imagine that this artificial intelligence is available to every owner of a mobile phone .
i &apos;ve been wandering around the newspapers and looking after the best headlines that i could find .
that we are not completely evolved as humans , as long as we &apos;re not caring about human rights and basic values .
today we want to talk about how video is going to come up , and then i follow why it &apos;s all important .
we &apos;re up to this device with our industrial partner , this new plastic skeleton that year .
no , they didn &apos;t break the building , it &apos;s like the architecture is almost disappearing .
it &apos;s almost physiologically impossible to be bad if you &apos;re wearing light red pants .
so , about a month after that i visited my daughter -- graduated , not much artistic talent ...
and this is a really profound thing , which is that i only want to get one of the wishes .
and after that , when i was thinking about this , i decided to ban negative energy from my life .
and then he said three words -- the pentional words that i &apos;ve ever heard .
i met with his father and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;re going to give you this money .
during the ice mountain , it &apos;s going to clean out all the oily internal freshwater , which creates a lot of life .
and that &apos;s the beauty of creating things that are used and interact with people .
i got another gift , which is to see the future and come back and go to life .
the rotor is a moving part within the centrifuge , which is the black object you see .
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the dumest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
well , just to finish , i want to acknowledge that i &apos;ve talked a lot about the fathers .
now , you know , i want to maintain certain separate addition , anatomically , in our culture .
to understand that these categories are really much more insecure than we thought , actually , i &apos;m really depressed .
we go down to the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
it &apos;s also true of race , as much more complicated than our terminology has been approved .
i was the second volunteer on the tent , so i was quite good at that .
more than anything else , everything else is my only goal in life , a good father .
so we thought that we could start to write a whole new chapter in ground mobility .
what would you do , because they think they &apos;re forever going to be there ?
this is one of the images we &apos;ve held with the so-called miixx-flight technology .
if someone would ask you to write their brand quality , your brand , how would it be ?
they push out the decision -- push them up , even if it comes to your own best .
do you know how many decisions do you make in the nine minutes category in the one hour ?
one of the things that you already know has been approved , there &apos;s a lot of momers .
this is the first object you can see , which was in the quantum mechanical superposition .
that &apos;s not like that , and maybe just because i don &apos;t play with these things so often .
i &apos;m going to zoom in in one of my favorite grade of this picture , until i really go into the cracks .
and so i started playing around , and i noticed that there was something happening .
the ones that want to make a choice will lead 20 fund , not 300 or more fund .
so , for example , the number 164 is going to get out of that code ; you can &apos;t see it .
just tell me a little bit of what your thoughts and feelings is about you .
woman # 2 : partly , part piece , part of the brooklyn girl -- i don &apos;t know .
and the brand i am is , i would say , bes. fly .
but why ? well , transparency is fear -- like this strange bear , still crying .
so we might sell a shoe , and it &apos;s going to be the greatest shoe you ever wore .
and so the film is going to study this whole idea -- this is what ? in &apos; unclear , ?
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we discovered -- made me really out of socks .
for those non-engineers , bropersona was one more material , electronics just became one more material .
where they go , hundreds of thousands of people working with them to finish their epic mission .
we have so many people in the world right now that are going to spend at least one hour per day .
our memory tells us stories , which is what we can keep with our experience is a story .
now , if i ever opened the folder open with 600 images , i would have spent another hour .
so if you &apos;re lucky enough to maximize the two types of self , you will do very different things .
and in reality , if we fail when we fail on the obstacles , we often feel different .
so i looked at games like the world of warcraft that offers the ideal environment to the collaborative .
this chart is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time again , if we have a projector .
hundreds of thousands of tickets deaths in a country that is worse than any other one of this disease .
they were playing , according to decoruuotus , video games , in the kingdom , as well as a famine .
there was such a famine famine that the king of lyuri turned into a crazy idea .
and geologists found evidence of a global complaint that could explain nearly 20 years , which could explain famine .
we have this banner in palo alto in palo alto , which is how we should understand the future .
but if you &apos;re in a epic adventure and you say , &quot; we &apos;re going out of oil . &quot;
we know from the study that you have to grab on a needle when it &apos;s supposed to go .
and the last game we &apos;re going to do on three march . it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
it would have been without the environmental ground , but the power also has been so much more important .
there &apos;s a liquid reactor , which seems to be difficult , but maybe that &apos;s about us .
bill gross has several companies , among others , a name called esolar technologies .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can even use the waste of today as propulsion engine .
well , we go to the destination that we need to achieve , and then we talk about the interline .
we need market incentives , co2 taxes , cap &amp; amp ; trade stuff that creates a price .
we need to take dialogue and complete space and also lead to the things that government will be completed .
i really hope that we &apos;re going to play major games to survive on this planet .
and that &apos;s because these fanatics , who i didn &apos;t have any fanatics .
climate change deniers : do you have one or two sentences for you to convince you ?
do you say that there are negative effects that have to do with the clouds , the things ?
and so i thought this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a design workshop .
they reformed the demographics of the earth in a way that no war has ever done .
and listen , everybody has a right to think , in fact , to his opinion of the progress of progress .
and the point is that the computation of a supercomputer is that people only have 23 years on the planet .
and they also have -- even though it &apos;s great , they don &apos;t need fuel -- they &apos;re dragging some cuts .
imagine the screen could just appear in different formats or sizes , in different ways .
if you turn on the lights , it looks like this . so , the same way we saw it before .
this is just a little taste of the insights that bonobos bring us into our past and present .
in this case , i worked with people , the body types , the social norms of question .
what are we going to do with the fact that we &apos;re going to distinguish ourselves through a few nuclear tides ?
when these dots fall down , you can write the patterns , images , text signals .
and this is what brought us to think about the following project that i &apos;m going to show you now .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , who lived about six million years ago .
you &apos;ve got to go up to the fire , and you have to get a few shoes . &quot;
that can be , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol .
now , the first time i was in antarctica , almost 10 years ago , where i saw my first polar mountains .
ice mounds are born as cald-a glacier , or break out from ice shells .
so basically , i &apos;m about this : if you see something that &apos;s impossible , then you can make it happen .
well , an epiphany is usually something that you find , because you fall somewhere else .
they live in the depths of the congolese chamber , and they &apos;re difficult to get to the observation .
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their school assignments under the street .
or are we something else to be adapted -- something that might even be adapted to the environment ?
and this also shows the entertainment value of this speech , so i hope , d .
they don &apos;t have these people as broken and damaged ; they were treated as something special and more valuable .
and i &apos;m hearing a guy who says , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee &apos;s mullins . &quot;
and i said , &quot; excuse me , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
in the &apos; 60s , in britain , there was a case study in britain .
but anyway , they &apos;re a wonderful setting for these bacteria , just as they &apos;re important for your lives .
and we might know how many wood we are , if we really get forward .
and so , by the way , 500 years has been since i have to say , very successful introduction .
evolution is all about continuing to the next generation of the genome to the next generation , both and survival generation .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily require the richest , the most powerful or the fastest , and not even the smartest .
and the argument that i think is that the wheels of evolution are slow , but they are unbeatable .
do we use these decisions to form a society that &apos;s better , the more successful ?
it feels what i want to do where i want to go and increase my strength .
these are energy farms , you talk about many square kilometers , thousand times more area than a normal power station .
now , a language is not just the kind of vocabulary of vocabulary or a series of design .
and the idea was really true for them , you know that there are people living with mosquitos .
and so this question was so disconnected that we decided to explore the answer and sictiers .
this is a game with words that is a kind of mixture of scorble and bogetist .
that &apos;s great . the romans didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly clever individual .
but again , very rare , something special happened : one of the performer actually happened .
you know , if you want to know the level of sea level , you put it down into the ocean .
here are the ones that have been eradicated in the last couple of years , with some green alternatives that were proposed .
waiting around christmas was walking in my home in tennessee , one billion tons of coffp .
you can do that because if you &apos;re very close , they become so-called supercreal .
in fact , we thought that there &apos;s the end here , but we tried to get the process a little bit further .
and it &apos;s about a playful , creative , original way of solving a problem .
and that &apos;s where the visitors could go into the room , sit on this chair , put this helmet .
and so you can accelerate the particles too far enough and then go into the bites .
so , you know , as citizens being able to be able to be able to be able to get apart with this scientific technology .
now , how is this with the virtual design that actually is the most natural thing in the world .
the question i want to show you today is : is this idea for you completely , right ?
and they &apos;re more divided over the course of centuries , more and more divided by the impacts of the machine &apos;s machine .
so these are all flickr pictures , and they all stay in place with each other in relation to each other .
instead , they go to the doctor and the doctor tells you , we could do a design , or we could make b .
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re going to be set up by the mind . how can you get damage ?
you can only be able to be done with some other chemicals that the mao rists .
well , that doesn &apos;t give you a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than the ganina .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering , if you haven &apos;t seen it on top of it .
and this is a symbol for the resistance of the inuit and all of the native native in the world .
but these concepts of the cyber-age that gives us these things back back our qualities .
and the more i thought about it , the more i came to see the fish .
something so profound as our identity is now a question of choice , like this slide show .
by the way , there &apos;s a corner that i &apos;m not going to tell .
you want to cut down at the bottom , cookie , blah , blah ... &quot; and so on , he said .
i had very low expectations . i had no physical expectations when they were just in a way .
i &apos;m pretty sure we &apos;ve missed that moment a long time on the selection .
what happens is the machine age , and what happens is that the book is the photolitography .
their predator could smell the urine of an animal from 40 steps and determine what kind of species that was theirs .
now , when i look here , i see the athletes that appear in this scale and the athletic species .
it &apos;s always about trying to understand the world and look at the limits of the potential .
and my head became weak above this boofied piece of delicious that i had at the evening .
they breed in a city of 240 kilometers where the surface environment is better for the nest .
we love mubarak markets . we love small family skills . we &apos;re talking about local food . we eat food .
that was the cause . it was the right-worked . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
now , our crops is endangered today , not because of abmal viruses , but because of the resources of thousands of resources .
well , he mentioned some algae , and some fish fish , and then he said , chicken flavors .
the energy hunger of the world , which is going on , is opaque because you don &apos;t need approval .
in the math class , i was always caught out of the teacher as i was , in my feet .
i could make my preference for the underwater world and the diving diving with the filmto the film.
our intention was to look inside and look into the inside of the ship , which had never been done before .
and there &apos;s certainly ambiguity about how bad these consequences become , but they will be incredibly bad .
these are very good things and poverty reduction , almost everyone on the planet will make accessible to everyone on the planet .
and then he goes and fall into more lessons from rare birds and algae and weird water plants .
so here &apos;s a very basic service . there &apos;s light at home so you can read the homework ?

and what we did , we , the humanity , is , we started too abstract .
i brought my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , grandmother , i &apos;m going to do this . &quot;
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our kids into the natural world with their technology .
it &apos;s important for me to create something that is also very time-consuming .
the vast majority of mass fighters in this country didn &apos;t really find in the class of violent crimes .
i think it &apos;s extremely sensitive to us that we are the end product of evolution .
the newly day day they did them -- ms. printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
so these tended to survive , and they increased them in scale .
one of the most important things is that we have to think about government is not the same as politics .
it &apos;s very important that these tsunami work , but people steal the batteries .
my hometown of alabama , they take them in the law right now when they &apos;re sentenced .
and if you take a picture with a camera , the process ends when you press on the trigger .
i even knew the differential diagnosis to classify tenacious tukers .
because obviously , an animal becomes a lot of , obviously , before it dies .
over time , it changes . it changes , because for the people , of course , they are their actions .

they have companies like neses , fecks , hallmark , custom mark , to find these brand personality .
but technology is not the way you &apos;re supposed to describe something that someone is doing .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration and tell you some interesting things that have happened since the launch .
now , morgan , in the name of transparency this : what happens to the $ 7100 ?
well , because the film at the sundboyfriend of &quot; on &quot; a &quot; premiere &quot; &quot; we can see that .
you can do it and make your own museum -- from all these images , you can put your own collection of your own collection .
i think the gene , the style that i have is probably &quot; dark glamour . &quot;
in 2007 , i had decided that we should think that we should think about economic development .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera , &quot; mean , that we wanted to make a leap .

my mother worked on farms , then on an outline factory , six days , double layers .
i just heard in a hotel room in sydney when she died , a thousand miles away in melbourne .

and he showed up the bus charges that would come every day and had their cameras had to do .
today , i &apos;d like to talk to you about one of the biggest decision-making problems in our modern time , the decision-making chain of time .
in the meantime , in the same year at bell labs , the next revolution was announced , the next building .
again , people , different color , represented in anatomical varieties of anatomical differences , again , successfully .
heinrich can marry a woman , but maria can only marry a woman , but maria can only marry a woman .
and i want to show you , this is a young female , and she plays it with the water .
for example , for example , i worked with people who are twins twins , two people in a body .
but because this individual is missing the spaghetti line to detect testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t react to the testosterone .
the elders of the old world didn &apos;t have a concept based on the dna , but they had a concept of the birth right .

then we have the little chips , the little brands , on the garbage , and start tracking it .
you can have some kind of flexible screen or display , like these -- an equal formation in two dimensions .
don &apos;t wait for a difference in another life of another , until you reach your first million .
through my work , i try to express that people are not separate from nature , and that everything is connected .
we want to think about the best outcome , and then empowering people to get this idea into reality .
find out how they would survive . most of our players have gotten the use of habits .
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfect to your current level in play , right ?
you &apos;ve got to hear &quot; level high &quot; and &quot; + one starch &quot; or &quot; + one . &quot;
and the only problem is they believe you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real ones .
his work is brilliant . he studied why people spend so much time , energy and money in online worlds .

wiwities aren &apos;t any obstacle that we need to look at in order to get better .
and we don &apos;t like that if we don &apos;t have to adapt to our kids that they cannot adapt .
the human part of this bupper , far at the end , is that , of course , is what we &apos;re most interested in .
and so the idea is that we actually do people with people where they do things together , collectively .
60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they will increasingly happier , the poorer they will .
and i was taken by a piece of the puzzle to the next katapults , and the edges of the scars .

and the next piece of play is about four women in three generations that are building a new life .
there was a meeting to the reconciliation and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go from the road . &quot;
so we could easily easily end the world very easily with fragrance , maybe even hundreds of new cities .
but the amazing thing about cities is that it &apos;s worth as much more valuable than it costs to build it .
so for me it seemed about so much to be in the right place to be the right place at the right time .
so i wanted to create something else , something that starts the process when the catalyst is censored .
we have three perfect physical objects that we can all relate to in a three-dimensional world .
so we overlist our brains , because our brains don &apos;t really feel that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to get a realistic outcome .
i &apos;ve tried to see what valuable cities are to do how much more valuable than they cost .
the reason why i &apos;m going to do my wrist is because it &apos;s the secret secret of illusion .
but look , the problem was that my idea had a fatal mistake , and that was this .
i have to talk to the guy who are like me , otto-normal consumers .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and it looks beyond his life support .
it might say , say , an us- american power station , or a chemical plant in germany .
so , we were able to get the little digital warhead with the ropcontrol with the rop control .
the big digital seahead -- we got a sense of very detailed data and data structures .
so , in large and large , we &apos;re very hopeful that we actually have , actually , what the goal is .
part of the ice in the ice , i &apos;m a very young -- a few thousand years old .
so , imagine you &apos;re at the same time at the same time , what would it feel like ?
but normally i have a accessories app like sunglasses , or a jewelry jewelry and a kind of stuff .
and you can see it here , target , tables , mini coopas and the golden blue .
i think , finally , to me , is the main thing that all the wonderful things are not from google .
i mean , i hope we &apos;re working with this digital medium of art , and they &apos;re kind of right online .
this was the state of physics a few years ago ; it took mechanics around the little , tiny particles .
maybe a little too long time , if you think about solving many problems in the real world .
they don &apos;t teach these kids anymore . that means nothing is being done , they &apos;re actually dead .
a colored capsule that &apos;s very yellow and on the other red is better than a white capsule .
so virtual ality is suddenly alien to us , and has nothing to do with reality .
maybe you can get up , so you can get up with the two things that you can talk about .
we &apos;re not going to answer them immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s going to happen right now .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s rooted in ourselves that we can deal with virtuality so well .
shamans , priests , of the harmonories , were placed for extra ways to keep knowledge in stories .
you may probably know that if you &apos;re a little bit more interested in this , you &apos;ve probably seen the australian epidemic .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the navigation and the topography of the regions could be captured via songs .
and there &apos;s so controversial things like all of this whole set of readoma plants on the payload .
it &apos;s been lit up by the inside and down , and everything lit up by a divine fire .
i &apos;ve just wondered if this bag is a speaker bag and i &apos;m going to talk to you .
not that if i think there &apos;s a non-zero-sum environment and the neighbor &apos;s worth less green , it doesn &apos;t work all the way .
because often people get people , they can &apos;t be able to use it , so everyone can handle it .
and what does mean , of course , intuitively , and how do we work our laws of perception and how does it work ?
this is what &apos;s called the &quot; law law , which is even happening to us in perception .
and so from the interest of this technology , i &apos;m going to go into that technology .
but what i want to say is that , of course , it &apos;s a corresponding increase for us to do things too .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how it &apos;s going to happen . we know exactly how the genetic code is going to be .
in a short period of time , we think we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
the suffering can be irarable , but the most salient spirit of the people is a little questionable .
if we ask these kinds of thousands of world world cultures , they respond to the importance of human beings , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
now you have to know that the inuit were not afraid of the cold . they used them to their advantage .
we can aggregate 27 million different users together from the components that are being made in this business .
i &apos;m absolutely certain that life can move in space looking for aquatic conditions .
this is the way i say i would say , throw your kid , warm it only for three times five .
so if you want to do it better , you &apos;ve got to pop up here and do your share .
this is what i work . it &apos;s called a atlas detector -- 44 meters in the width , 22 meters in diameter .
at minus 271 degrees , hotter than the space between stars , these wires can sustain tension .
and in one of the connections between a thousand thousand magnets in the lhc , there was a factory defect .
and so the wires and the wires get smaller , and at a half a thousand amdas , suddenly meas-resistant resistance .
when i heard that , i was thinking that &apos;s beautiful -- this is exactly what my creative process is .
i think it &apos;s a different thing , and beautiful , it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better .
not change and technology threaten the integrity of race . it &apos;s power . the ugly face of rule .
in the rich world , diseases that have millions of us are even more likely to be even more likely to do .
and we &apos;ve never been able to put it into reasonable , just like we can now .
i mean , every one of us here could change five times as much for our energy without changing its lifestyle .
and even though it seems to be really easy , it &apos;s actually really difficult to work on .
and peter tells you , &quot; neither of the children in the day of the spaghetti gmbh . &quot;
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time , and what happens ?
so the performance of working with prototypes is far -- but let &apos;s see how different teams are building .
and i thought , &quot; wow , this is the same as if i was in a science-fiction of science .
if we can do that , this will be a new source of data , perhaps a new source of information .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vaccines for the new yorker , a little article .
but i was worried about this article , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and then i found it out .
bp , bhopal , the challenger , vimatically x , the u.s. presidential presidential , the u.s. presidential election .
that &apos;s the planet that we live in . don &apos;t pretend it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy of our own , and we really have to lie .
but in art and studying , there is no alternative to the art , because there is no doubt there .
in fact , it &apos;s kind of on the place that i can shake it without blowing the knife .
immediately , you &apos;re going to have one , you know , for granted , you know , that you can &apos;t prove it .
that is , at the moment , you have to make sure that renewables can take the whole web .
you could easily throw a liter of cigarettes into a liter of cigarettes , and then it &apos;s going to be it .
unfortunately , unfortunately , they don &apos;t know , but maybe you can take the french man a little bit .
his cause to write the piece , gets more and more and more to my personal concern , to play it .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about , who has to make themselves deceive themselves .
and if you place the exact two inches in the middle between two equal and then you &apos;re going to place it .
and what &apos;s great about this is that the crime rate in the favelas to go over tens of thousands of percent .
this is really important , because this is an insight that doesn &apos;t exist in a single kind of wikipedia .
that is , if you &apos;re nine percent renewable , you won &apos;t do that without memory .
they built this complicated set of channels , and they held water out of the land and out into the river .
the vegetable biomass , the phytoplankton , the zoopplankton , which is what the fish feeding .
you know , it &apos;s right , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it will be delicious .
now what we have here are the cover of every single &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and these two pictures , and these two of these demands -- from the same altitude , and the same lights .
i negotiate the agreement to rehyvate it and asked my colleagues to organize him .
if i knew in a room -- well , i have no idea what you think about me .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve reached in the last century , so we can predict the evolution .
four years ago , we launched a new university called singularity university .
napolemaysoldiers were given silver bikes , napoleon himself , napoleon .
they live in a world that has information and communication , as nobody ever could predict .
i &apos;m going to dwell on a statistic that i hope most of you have heard before .
never make a mistake , nobody &apos;s going to matter about the details of what this is supposed to do .
once in high school , a student said that brian goldman would learn for a bloody test .
and it was my mission when the emergency community carilology was looking at the emergency patient .
this mental orientation is the core of what i think the ted communities have to be involved in .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , the time by the end of the reconstructing , to the beginning of the second world war .
in a hospital system where medical knowledge has doubled every two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up .
we have an cognitive mistakes so that we can take a perfect seismic rate for a patient with chest pain .
i &apos;m stuck in . but i &apos;m going to try to learn the other way to share it .
this story we &apos;ve heard many times from the galapagos , or in other places , it &apos;s not very special .
my third little story told me of my collaborators in the introduction of the rail fisheries in southeast asia .
and this was an example of how our own governments are doing the technology against us , the citizens , in slavery .
there are several well-known cases of online groups , multi-millionaire , who made their money through attacks .
if you &apos;re being blinded in a criminal case , it &apos;s quite safe to put your phone .
that we need to combine our visions of technology and design , of entertainment and to the justice .
so it &apos;s all the tools there , and the only thing that separates us is our imagination .
when we don &apos;t relate to that with these difficult issues , the positive and wonderful things are also affected .
in fact , the recipe for us , which is our genes , which is exactly the same code and the same writing .
we are so far that we can write , just to be able to write ourselves in this code .
make the techniques that are easy to use and start to give you patients in the team .
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like the peace corps for computer geeks .
it was about a method with the parents to find out which the right public schools are for their children .
and as many people , i thought it was mainly about elecding people to office .
they don &apos;t fight the battle that we &apos;re all fighting , about who to be talking about ; they &apos;re all going to speak .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a way from the past world to a new kind of world .
so in other words , the future is a year for every year since i am on this world .
and every time it reverberates , the other part of it has to spread in the other amount of chemicals .
and i think the most important point here is that we stopped talking with our patients .
we would never fly someone with an airplane if for nine planes , sending off , one drops down .
let &apos;s say , i want to rank numbers that would be a simple example that i &apos;ve been used for .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i &apos;ve ever had on hand .
so we &apos;re starting to rely on computers for a process that is very different from the classical engineering theory .
well , the lunch is before , and i &apos;m thinking i &apos;m going to be here now before i &apos;m going to try .
when we wanted to stop indians at the time , we would go into a car and shoot over the sky .
the poor apsardinas were caught thousands of years in drcide , in an old sel book .
and sometimes , when something comes from ted , it gets something and strength that otherwise wouldn &apos;t have otherwise .
well , i was nine years old , and so i said , &quot; yes , grandmother . i promise it . &quot;
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones were produced -- or 75 rocks for each person on the planet .
well , i don &apos;t know how to play , but i want to show you some unique footage from the wild .
i think it &apos;s just like you &apos;re playing ourselves alone , and we spin boundaries of our interior and the deep worlds .
i thought that the time i spent in this hospital was just amazing -- except to my physiological therapy .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if they could change the cells of their paycheck ?
his flexible design allows to be able to homble up , and very regular movements .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear that the trees were confusing .
and when you watch bonobos play at play , you see evolutionary evolution , dance and rituals .
they found 500 creative solutions that can be able to read when they &apos;re called &quot; superwindle . &quot;
but it &apos;s always on the edge of their ability , so they have to be hard , but there &apos;s no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
in fact , our system is based on the idea that a certain anatomical measures with a particular identity has been completed with a particular identity .
but the challenge is to try and figure out which it is and why we keep them , and think of it .
i spent a lot of my life , trying to be myself , adapt to me at the same time .
because the lesson i &apos;ve been trying to do this week is that it &apos;s okay to let us go ahead .
so in this project , we actually designed a few little markers to track the garbage while it comes through the system .
in particular , the last two words fall under fall under the last two words under near bin and &quot; healthy . &quot;
there are no doors or windows , but if you &apos;re approaching it , it will open and put it in .
and that &apos;s getting worse , and pretty soon , kids are going to die again because that &apos;s just a matter of numbers .
in the next 50 years , we &apos;ll have 70 percent more food than we currently have , 70 percent .
and if you look out for ocean water and just stack layers , you get enough fuel for the earth &apos;s lifetime .
unfortunately , it &apos;s all the good news , because there &apos;s a few other problems , and they &apos;ve been told .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements a billion people in the world are hungry every single day .
but now it comes : if you get evidence you have to adopt this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at that .
he gets calls at home because people like to tell him they know where his children go to school .
and if it &apos;s wireless , if you want to attack the syringes , you can even drop the roof .
we feel overwhelmed . we fear ourselves . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or monumental .
i know we can , and as far as i &apos;m concerned , this is what the world needs now .
and the surprise is that patient is a much worse reminder of the observable reflection as a patient .
the stories of the gut mirror were different , and because a very important part of the story is that it ends up .
and the main lesson that i think we &apos;ve learned is that they &apos;re really different .
dk : so , you know , i believe that it &apos;s fair for the role of happiness in politics .
and the first project is something that we did a few years ago in an amaza , spain .
so , in total , if we &apos;re optimistic , we might get a factor three or maybe even a factor of six .
we had a team that was working on a project last year in boston , for three people and months .
and sure , we would have these fire hydrant bent all the time , and a lot of people do it .
here &apos;s a clear car manufacturer that gives you the opportunity to reframe their car itself .
half of the customers is going to go from the many ways , 56 bootcolors to the low opportunities , four motors .
last year headvaszquez had this video that he had shot in the yosemite national park .
she reminded me that i was so old as she was when we walked the boat .
there was a energy , an unlegitimate human optimism , a strange mix of humility and ridicule .
they &apos;re more likely to make themselves happier , even if they make it more objective .
this is the left half that &apos;s the logical hand , and then the right half is the right side .
so the nervous system has changed the evolutionary process of this specialized information , because evolution could now happen within an individual to place .
one way which is particularly interesting , and what i &apos;ve been used to spend very much is evolution itself .
now i say , &quot; computers , take those 10 percent of the sequences that i got in the next place .
it became a gulf access to a world full of pirates and haver ships and some of my imagination in my imagination .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device to communicate readers around the world .
and the first thing i ask the employees is , &quot; tell me how to distinguish from each other .
and then we started , we went down to the bismarck , and we explored with robotic designers .
and who knows when the film comes out , maybe we look like a horde calida .
it turns out that it meant that , &quot; we don &apos;t want to do it with your movie . &quot;
then one day , he came back from walking and said , &quot; dad , my legs glaze . &quot;
it takes the same -- he would need to take love and pleasure . and it &apos;s on us to give these things .
as i was thinking about it later , i noticed a phrase that says , &quot; i collect bad dishes . &quot;
so what we were looking at is , what we were looking for was the communication system , because we know what it does .
ralph , it &apos;s reported that people assume that the thylacine sad is the main organization behind it .
it could have an impulse to have a impulse that comes from people from the motions of people or something .
each of you , everybody -- whether rich or poor , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
and every time i interview someone , i can say , &quot; are you extra enough for this interview ?
so doing these things -- you know , remind people about ban -- that &apos;s sort of why we &apos;re interested .
throughout the city , for five years , for five years , there was no time , no poster , no line , nothing .

so you can see that this is a lot of information and data in this way , is remembered very much in a living information graphics .

there are very , very few things you can even tell , which there is a chance in a million .
if the bottom line you get is a very high amount of energy , then you can only match the rich .

or photographs like this -- dark and colorful , but all with the common goal , to keep a realistic level .
now the average age of our head is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , a generation older than most of you .
and this is a novelty that we have to use this type of scale to semi-logarithmic curves in the area of technology .
and yes , i &apos;ve even transformed the house up on the island of red to make it look a second .

now after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that it &apos;s mainly in communities to be auduze .

so this slide shows data from us from the performance of risc processors with the performance of risc computing .
another idea that fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can be in a single marble .
either it gets an classic curve like this , until something completely new comes from here , or it will happen here .
so the question i &apos;d like to ask , and i &apos;m also looking for myself , is like this new world ?
so , to do this , i &apos;ll first talk about some other things that really have nothing to do with technology or computer .
if i was actually a selfish , i would have written it on a virus , and i would have written it in the room .
now this communication allowed us to support communities that were in a certain sense , in a certain sense , they were synersy .
i mean , i don &apos;t mean magician and dragon , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children .
like the outside block , the transistor allows us much greater , more powerful , more powerful , a rock for the other .
all the kids from aagoza came to the building , because the way they were playing with the building was very different .
imagine a helicopter , like you saw earlier , that moves with others , completely in synchrony .
and i want to think about the possibilities of how democracy might look like , or looked , if we &apos;d had the mothers more involved .
so for years , since i was involved in interphysiological , i &apos;ve also been interested in research in gender .
but the more i thought about his question to so much i thought was that there was something worthy about feminism .
if you think you &apos;re inside and you &apos;re a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
another example of it is that it &apos;s not about people , but it &apos;s not about people that we use and consume .
now they did it for part because they were part of a fault system where two things grew together .
they &apos;ve got somebody &apos;s nose &apos;s nose , and if they moved , they haven &apos;t buried her .
but then , once we have all of the imagery points , you can play with it and play color with gravity and motion .
it &apos;s not a death , if you melt ; it &apos;s not a end , it &apos;s a defenment of your legal cycle .
you can see here , it &apos;s starting to roll , and the boat moved to the other side , the man is there .
at the end of the sander , he gave us an email with the content , &quot; for the first time in seven years , i drew a little bit drawn .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the eyewriter -- everything was impossible at all .
so there are some anatomical caps that make sense for me , and that we think should be , i think , should be .
and i should say that i &apos;ve got the building garment burn , and i want you to be ready . &quot;
i think the biggest damage we &apos;ve been given ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
and of course , it breaks off the heart that conversely was told to be told , it was only enough .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to a single outcome . players are super powerful , hopeful individuals .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re going to get rid of not less than a mass irgration in virtual worlds and online play environments . &quot;
so , he says it &apos;s perfectly logical that the players are more time in the virtual world than in the real world .
sometimes i do that , sometimes it &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s barely too present , but it &apos;s constantly at me .
but the most important thing is that between the perception of our flaws and our great , inspiring minds , there is a connection .
we looked at them , we laughed , we laughing , and we knew that they would be in a hospice .
now , you can imagine how amazing it is when children are born , who are two people in a body .
imagine , i said , through a few changes of their genes , a better memory could have a better memory -- more powerful and faster .
and most importantly , with the advent of sexual reproduction that gives the genome on , the rest of the body is essential .
a second possibility is that it will be a evolution of the traditional way , of course , by the forces of nature .
not too long after entering a doctor in my hospital room , and he said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;ll never walk again . &quot;
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the technologies to meet us and to discuss with them .
i was the one who was beaten every week in the children &apos;s children and blue , until a teacher saved my life .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to pursue what happens to people who are going to go to the hope of becoming happier .
the other thing that we want to ask is that companies all over the world are helping us to help this acivilization .
and then seattle decided to use the app to get the police gulter to cleaning the clogged guls .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we were told each other of our day , and they were listening to the movements of our grandmother in the house .
and it was my job to stay waking up every night until your own dreams came to me so that i could open it up .
so i was talking about jugengic and training , and the realization of the marginal and periled .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world and how it can be done in a two-dimensional surface .
it &apos;s pretty simple : every time i go to the scale , they send my data to google health .
my mother may be 18 when her father died -- already in a arranged marriage , with two little girls .
and that was something surprising and humorous , a casey was watching the idea of five million times .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out we &apos;re very good in the collective act with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a big community of people who make resources that we need to put things together together .
and the next set that we got was , &quot; i went over , found the trash bin from the house .
so if you &apos;re faced with the government problem , you don &apos;t care so much about using your voices .
in any way we don &apos;t quite understand , this drip has been the ability to write information .
after a four-year and movie saga bottle of a boat hanging hanging on to the lake as a fishing boat .
what really tells us is that we could think about ourselves and beyond other people in the sense of two types of self .
simple , you go in -- and i created this , which is the power of the -- you can zoom around .
so we go out and play it and start reacting , and then we start to develop our intuition .
i realized then by putting the points with each other that life is about to be a great father .
i spent the last couple of years trying to place myself in situations that usually are very difficult and at the same time , at the same time .
but in the new project that i &apos;m working on , my new film , we explore the world of marketing , the advertising .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with this film , because they didn &apos;t have control over the finished product .
there &apos;s the uloiiiizi , the moma , the riics , the rijk , the van gogh .
in my own humanity , and with my mistakes , i would inflate it , in everything i would fit .

so as you can see , my desire to do is to make new human computer interface that fit better to what our brains and bodies work .
and the exciting phase came when we took this piece into this piece , and we had a bacteria , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made viral particles .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s certainly not cheap in a frame where it is clearly available .
and we hope , of course , is that we can also spread and also be similar to each other , so that savings can be involved in it .
the author of the book , jonathan jcheall , jonathan jcheall , we still have a mile one-and-a-half hours with the following stories .
do you have any fear of holding your whole life and never create a book that makes anyone interested in the world ? never again ?
that is , instead of being individually , we have standardized , widespread , in vast forms of memories we can hang out of our own personal memories .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions , whether that means that means all the tasks i &apos;m going to do is to get a good grade in my class .
one guy in mine had access to investment records from a million employees , the giant fountains of roughly a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
now , if you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of its extraordinary discoveries . for example , this plant .
he had smuggled into prison at two years to hide himself under her rocknim , because she couldn &apos;t live without her .
when people have freedom , each of us is for themselves to do things that promote our careers , and nobody has no idea for us .
so you have to deal with what means that , because it &apos;s not just the way that it &apos;s different , but it &apos;s also going to be better .
and even though the answer to the question &quot; no , &quot; will surely be your experience of the football game of your child &apos;s very different than it has been .
we &apos;ve digitized nearly 20 years . when we sequenced the human genome , we &apos;ve gone from the analog world of biology to the digital world of the computer .
because it &apos;s 50 percent fund , who are giving to choice , it &apos;s so hard to decide what to choose , that they put it up tomorrow .
the reason i felt worse was that i was feeling worse with all these available possibilities , for what a good pair of jeans went , went up .
you know , i &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects before the human genome , and what that might mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
and as you can see , it &apos;s a very island area , and you have to sort of navigate , from the island to an island , to get food .
they have a vague language and a married script that is called linguistic exotic , you have to marry somebody who &apos;s talking to a different language .
so if we look at the development of our society , we &apos;re going to move forward to the third of the fourth generation , or social form .
and what happened was something interesting . what really happened to me about jacques cousteau &apos;s shows was the thought of a completely unknown world on our earth .
and the film studio , i did this as &quot; &quot; romeo and juliet on a ship . it became a love movie , a passionate movie .
and so this is important because you just look at what &apos;s been looking at online websites in this way , the whole kind of internet level in the same way .
jacques cousteau came into our living rooms with his fascinating shows to animals and places and a world full of wonder that we could never have imagined before .
we had to all do that . if we read a book as children , we took the description of the doctor and the foundation they had on our heads .
they &apos;re looking out at the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all you see is curved ; and these density , lussty march .
of course , the stories that i were looking for was the story that i was looking for , of course , &quot; aliens , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; out .
a lot of arguing about it . wet facilities don &apos;t pollute the environment most of them , and they &apos;re inefficient , we &apos;re going to take tuna . a big disadvantage .
so i sat back with a little team on the very best place , and we looked at &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technique that didn &apos;t exist before .
so let &apos;s look at the fourth factor -- and this will be a key factor -- this is the amount of co2 that will be avoided per unit of energy .
and sometimes it &apos;s a little prototype of that experience , everything that takes us from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; in a &quot; &quot; &quot; da &quot; moment . &quot;
now , if i &apos;d like to get just one gulbal view , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at it . &quot;
and i wonder what they would choose , because i asked my friends at the last time , and they wanted to go to the past .
it &apos;s very direct advertising , not for the company puma , but for the company that you now help this company to make these products .
how big would it be to be a battery so that you have an island for 20 , 30 , 40 , maybe even 70 percent renewable .
because in general , by this new type of uses , the natural user , the natural user , are 10 times faster to our destination .
and because they work much tougher than we , and because it &apos;s only three to six months , they &apos;re living in your weight , in your weight , to a million people .
and it &apos;s an lust when you see in italy , like people in the high bow , and you can get coke in the high bow of the car .
it &apos;s not only a fundamental user revolution not only for apple &apos;s economic factor , most of the success factor , when i want to harness technology devices .
it &apos;s necessary to have your own experiences and ideas of music to make it over another possibility , so it &apos;s about an instrument to sound .
nathaniel left juilliard , suffered a nerve breakdown , and 30 years later , he lived as homeless homeless on the streets of skid row in los angeles .
and so we &apos;ve decided to build a hall in berlin , where we can actually map the electrical component of the island in scale to three .
and funny enough , she &apos;s in the &apos; 70s , in the &apos; 70s , had been developed , and then became licensed in the japanese .
it has a megawatt power , and it can take six hours to get this performance , and that &apos;s the battery that we can sort of get out of the box .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab and i started exploring this idea of how to put the power of the engineers in the hands of artists and designers .
what i know is that it seems to be really important to think about the idea that the united states has helped us wonder about democracy .
and they make a few tests , and they find that instead of getting an sticks and uterus , they &apos;re actually testiced and that they have a cat chromosome .
when we turned it down , the lights looked down and looked at the box , we saw that the piece of metal was always in a piece there .
over the film , we had more than 500 companies that were up and down and down , and the &quot; no &quot; said , &quot; they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
and he put it back to the first time his family and friends -- and you can imagine what was a feeling that was on the parking lot .
but for over two weeks , we have programmed , we went to the stealth mall in venice , my children , and we had this one .
and a kind of digital surveillance in the night -- but as most important , a new kind of experience for everybody who wants to go on the top .
i got a parking ticket , because i &apos;m not going to go down on the bike , but a lot of times there is disabilities that don &apos;t go on on the bike .
as you all remember , our founding fathers did the concept of the monarchy , and the monarchy in the bottom was because of a very innovative concept of anatomy .
i &apos;ve gone enough from my comfort to know that , yes , the world breaks apart , but not how you worry about it .
now , i don &apos;t want you to spend too much time for a while , because if you introduce all the time , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
and so , my primate , let &apos;s make this gift of evolution , and also play this gift of evolution , and rediscover it as we discover creativity and wonder .
but they also have a mystery for our future , a future where we need to adapt to solving a rising challenges , by greater creativity and more inclusive .
a place where women will lead to the following powers , with sex &quot; and the game -- where a lot is a serious issue .
well , in our city , in the killing of volunteers , we have to be pretty early at the tent to be able to be a very early job .
and these scientists have just embraced the different topics with these who have embraced this ceo , and how much time they make them spend decisions that relate to the issues .
i think we would all have the mood , the woody allen to understand the expression when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to do immortality through my work .
and the women came with their stories about men who couldn &apos;t get the change , angry and flexible , and disactively filled with kids , trapped between two worlds .
on nine people we were executed , one of the things we found for innocent sauce comes out of the death cell .
it says , &quot; this plane is made out of hundreds of thousands of little bits that work together to make their flight more productive . &quot; don &apos;t you really bother you ? &quot;
the transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of static , interconnected building building building a world in which everything would be interactive .
and then on a fuzzy day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun broke out , and i might feel better .
it can produce a thousand gallons of clean drinking drinking water a day -- whether water , polluted water , latrine -- and all this for less than two cents a liter .
it would feel like to live in a world where german state wanted to take people , especially when there was already a lot of jews .
and it was fascinating , because one of the scientists after my talk , and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s profoundly troubling , you &apos;re talking about listening . &quot;
and imagine i even negotiate as a five-year child with dr. p. , and so try to stop these practices , manipulation of gravity .
we believe that because you &apos;re so taught that the real question is : does a human being made to die for some crimes of him ?
so , the things that make a picture realistic , i think these are the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things around us in our lives .
in fact , the droplet , which went on to the growth of the growth , which was more and integrated more chemicals and more chemicals from the outside and divided faster .
the good news is that technology makes it possible to adjust the function of the government in a way that actually can achieve something by empowering society .
well , for those of us who have left the government , it &apos;s time to think about the world that we want to leave our children .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the doors in your house and see if the livestock skin ? &quot;
so an app , which is written in a few days , and then you spread from selels , is a kind of flying from the front of the front .
so think about that if it wasn &apos;t only possible , the gender of your child , but also in the body , to be able to cure the disease and prevent the disease .
and at the end , we &apos;re actually in a choice . do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotor or in a polychromatic world of biodiversity ?
so we &apos;re not just responsible for people that we love to preserve , but they &apos;re preparing to deal with it as well .
and then we &apos;ve been tuned in a mavn d , and we &apos;ve been tuned and then tried to focus on this camera and then try to focus on this camera .
they &apos;re also working in such an artistic aspect with biological materials , and , yes , also electronics , and combine that in a pretty open-ended way .
and i &apos;m going to have a lot of life experience than today and i &apos;m going to have a lot more colors in the process of music , emotions and emotion than today .
we only have for two years and already now , through the phosphorus mining world , much more uranium in the environment than in all nuclear plants .
but to me , in the realm of interactive media as particularly impressive , we &apos;ve lost in our biological memory , the ability to think of nonlinear memory .
and this wealth of the virtual wealth is to virtual phenomena , which has also had the people in the pre-industrial times , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
and we &apos;re going to get a lot of effort on the media campus for the virtual reality lab , and we can actually see that all the time .
and yes , a lot of what &apos;s been said today , i &apos;m very excited , because many , many beautiful expressions of that i &apos;ve been covering through .
and this is , yes , that &apos;s pretty young people , but the only thing that all of us are united is this fascination with technology .
and many discussions that i &apos;ve had over the last six years were similar to the discussion that i &apos;ve had over the last 30 years .
basically , you get every video on every sisiable letter , and as you try to educate words , they &apos;re going to think about a dictionary .
that &apos;s why we put it up to the top hand , a major amount of money to get an ad on the way to get the truth about coal .
if your work was brilliant , you didn &apos;t look at it all for you , everyone knew that you had this infinite genius that helped you .
we &apos;re going to turn it up , and we expect to be able to put the first data in june or in july , and we continue to figure out what the blocks of the universe are in the universe .
so it &apos;s gone . and for those of those who weren &apos;t there at the time , the lhc has been the largest scientific experiment ever -- seven miles in diameter .
i was seven when i &apos;d come back on one of his class , and i played the last of the four baloops of the missouri , a moment .
we &apos;re more years of doing people better . our goal is to make a chance for long enough to do that . thank you very much .
so , in any case , it will be an energy dealer that then , hydrogen , methane , power to gas , you know or warm , it will be .
and i can say that we now live in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen before , and hopefully never see again .
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can put it for 60 years -- think of a column -- you &apos;re buried without a column -- it &apos;s buried without all the complexities .
it &apos;s the desire to do that , immediately , to do something , a key to request with the belief that we have a customalized hope for success .
if you also play , you see some more shade here coming up , and the mouth are a sign of optimism . the eyebrows show surprise .
as you can grow happiness , you can get very different depending on how you think and whether you think or think about your own self or think about it .
i have the impression that if we do vacation doing this very often , that means we &apos;re doing holiday class in the service of remembering ourselves .
and in that way , time is actually the critical variable that is different from a living self , and it has very little input on this story .
we have all these superpowers , happiness productivity , the ability to form close social networks , distribuding optimism , and desire for epic importance .
but this one keeps me awake at night -- one of the things that keeps me waking up in night . we &apos;ve never known scientific progress as now , never yet .
we came to talk to music , and a few days later , i got an email , where bell was interested in gverbs for me .
but the twist was really right back , and the people in my company told me that we haven &apos;t really been able to do that .
and it worked . again , we created something word , and the effect in the audience was the same , but we played a little bit more money with the movie .
and we turned around the corner , and we provided the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands of study of the study of the way , which is literally the eye .
no , i actually deased myself from this fish , because i swear god , the fish for chicken .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tunas that we love , the tuna , the salmon , they collapsed .
we want the world of creators , the inventor , who encourage the most , because this world in which we live , these interactive world , are ours .
not just from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the capacity of the people to survive and to thrive , is governed by conflicts .
if i look at the next decade , i &apos;m sure to be in two things : that we can create any conceivable future , and that we can play all kinds of games .
what they came back with was an anatomical concept , and they put it through another , which was radical and beautiful , and 200 years to look at us .
and in this scenario , you can imagine that in one case the sperm one is a horse chomomatic , which hits the x chromosome of the cell cell .
a few weeks later , the firewalks had a letter named the owner of the owner in which she was running for the brave use of her house .
we &apos;re going to have a process that requires maybe 100,000 years , and we can compress it to a thousand years -- and maybe even on the next 100 years .
the same technology that makes the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only protecting themselves , but to be able to serve the immunity against other viruses .
it seems like we &apos;re right from the other parts of the building , but actually for the most part , our cells are quite the same .
and part of me wonder about what if the contents of a personality would be something that would be done in the future of the future -- using an fmri visible ?
i would write it this way : not the most powerful of the way , and not the most intelligent of the kind , but the one that can adapt the best .
i love to find a different kind of emotional , angry outfit , to wear , and i have recently come to photograph and blogging .
these are two very different units , the living self and remembering self , and the two of them , is part of the subspectrum of happiness .
there &apos;s a living self that lives in the present and the present is capable of experiencing the past , but essentially the present has to be .
the second case is a change of experience and memory : basically they &apos;re between to be happy in your life and happy with his life or happy with his life .
we have to lead these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go into the time machine and go into the future , we &apos;ll be happy to do it .
and you know what ? if i say that , people say it , and they say , &quot; what &apos;s you ? let &apos;s do whatever you want .
and in a few hours , he lands and guest a car , and it comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to come to a long time of beautiful ted dinner tonight .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream . &quot;
and the idea is pretty simple . four-year-olds have to be the biggest amount of free structure with 20 spaghetti tape , about 1m tape , about 12 feet , and build a marshmallow .
so if the transportation technology would be as fast as the microprocessor technology , we could get tomorrow tomorrow into a taxi , and 30 seconds we would be in tokyo .
personally , personally , that it &apos;s easier to create a place as a place , because you don &apos;t have to partner with the ideas in his head .
two years later , i had service in the emergency room in a communist hospital north of toronto , and i blogted a 25 year-old man with a mixed roby .
if you have a blind controller , and you become a carateur , your average performance , your average performance , your average performance .
last month , i had the pleasure of doing that , with qualk-y-foundation foundation that &apos;s called &quot; $ 10 million i refer to the x prize .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach us the process of truth and reconciliation .
of course , the chance of accident is very small that you can have a number of chance , so not the beneficicies of actually do this .
so if someone wants to take a million million copies of my business card , i have enough for everyone in this room , and even for everyone in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
bg : well , we need one of these scaling , distributed things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to do and use 20 years .
and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew that i needed several months to plan them , to find the different spaces of the puzzle .
i meet all kinds of fun people ; my dollars in usually a good purpose , i look at pretty unique ; and it &apos;s making shopping to my really personal screve .
in other ways , from the course of the 20th century , the participation of community is our way to become part of this phenomenon -- either by putting it out or doing something new that comes out of it .
well , if you do it , people would buy six times a glass of marxade , who had to give you six to choice than if they had to give them 24 to a choice .
and so i look as one of the people , along with most other experimental theory , who need a good amount of logic to add the complex ideas together .
well , there &apos;s conveyor brands and eight old brands , these things that come and go , but a broken , loud brand is a very powerful thing .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attacker -- you don &apos;t have to be able to do the material above a usb stick , as we saw it at stuxnet .
and i kept showing me over and over again , when people came to me in this week , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
and from my view , the scientific method is to see things , and see if it doesn &apos;t , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
and that really gives you the pleasure and the good experience , and read a real paper newspaper , or reading a kind of a kind of medium of multiple scales .
bg : well , the actual spending for the research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year than today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
we &apos;re going to use co2 that could be brought down , which could be brought down to small-scale amounts of fuel , distributing co2 in the fuel to power that process .
and i argued that we might be able to create a new form of the cambrian explosion that could give massive new species based on this digital design .
a humbling , if you have the full power with water , has enough pressure , so i think that &apos;s so 40 to six yards on it .
a project that i did with the hacking system in switzerland , was that we wanted to create a optical trap or optical fur .
i spoke to it : don &apos;t listen , you know , you , you , you , you and i both know , if this book isn &apos;t brilliant , that it &apos;s not entirely my fault , right ?
but then he became older and quiet . he told me that one day he went on a street street in los angeles , and he changed everything for him .
a process that &apos;s ever trying to -- like everybody who &apos;s ever tried to do something -- in other words , in fact , everyone here -- not always stimulating .
well , of course , on a way that triggers such accidents of accidents , the debate &apos;s worth of science and engineering in those boundaries . it &apos;s easy to reject something like this .
so as crazy as my talk may sound , this is what we &apos;re doing , we &apos;re moving physically , virtual worlds , very much after the model of the design .
we have now , from our discoveries from all over the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design of the future .
now , you &apos;re going to ask yourself , why are all the designers coming along with such natural , archaic archetforms of communication , interaction and so on .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of the species , and then it turned completely into a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given into the cell .
it was axiched in the cell and recognized the other chromosome as alien of the material , and so on the end , there was only one cell with a new chromosome .
in each step , we have produced these pieces in the surplus that we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process , which they &apos;re going to see in a minute .
the reason is that used to be better than anything worse , when anything was worse , it was possible for people to make a pleasant surprise .
so , to buy new jeans , after many years of the train , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have some jeans , here &apos;s my height . &quot;
we can watch our kids playing football , and we have our mobile phone on the one hip , and our blackberry on the other hip , and our laptop may be on our lap .
now it &apos;s not as easy now , but it &apos;s not impossible if you &apos;ve got enough curiosity and there &apos;s enough energy in it , you get that way .
the official dogma works like this : if our goal is to maximize public well-being , it &apos;s all of the way of the animal &apos;s freedom of freedom .
yes , that &apos;s a huge debate right now , moving from the coal economy , because we don &apos;t , or sanitation , because that &apos;s not .
and i went to berlin in the mid-80s to berlin , because i wanted to make renewable energies , and that &apos;s not what i didn &apos;t want to do .
i learned a lot about science , but i think now , you have to be a director , a leader has to be like a ship , like a ship capctor or something .
you go up into those capsule , and you place this dark , hostile environment where there &apos;s no hope to rescue , if you don &apos;t move yourself back .
i shaping my father until he finally had a trip in buffalo , new york , looking at the other side of the border where we lived .
and since there were no video games , or these overoluators with computer-generated films , i had to create the images in my head .
and my love to science fiction appeared in my environment , because at the time , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and study the deep sea .
we should call them what it is , a industry in bandater , a industry that allows fast public capital , which allows exactly this production .
it &apos;s very different from saying , we have a three-foot truck that has to be under a three-foot bridge , and you can sort of squeeze it down .
and our european composite grid is basically just as dense vast masses of big fuels , where the wave goes around around europe .
as you used to know in the village , who has what and when , you know , this is what &apos;s going to happen about this expansion of self through these mobile devices in a global scale .
but the logic of deception allows us to pretend to do it as though the first sentence is wrong , but you need to have granted the opposite without evidence .
and these verses that in the back of the bub already knew that he &apos;s actually related to the fire , but he can &apos;t say it .
i &apos;ve told my wife whenever a human being in a moral legal endeavor , because it uses , should we try to replace it through the literal self .
i can use the sound ideas today , which has the stream on the modern wing for sound , which can &apos;t be able to do a barok cemkko .
so these are the first shoes you can put on the footlight start and walk in the rubber lights , right ?
all right , so , very exciting processes that then happened in this , yes , is not actually , but here it is in this roolable mass right now .
so if you take the system as well as i &apos;ve been taught , and all the error of happiness , it &apos;s not going to be left at the end .
some time ago , if you wanted to win a formula , they took their budget and put their money on a good driver and a good car .
play is a shape-plate and it can adopt a lot of forms of some shapes , some of which , some calm , curious -- perhaps to explore again .
and my friends , the great , giant hollywood movies , say that the reason their movies are so successful in the brand aid that they have .
and if you &apos;ve already noticed that the fish logging from stuxnet complex and high-tech , let me tell you , use data is a science for itself .
so , this really got my interest , and we started working with it almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
and there may be pretty much the toughest people in the street scene -- banksy , sheko shepard , caws -- all these guys will be there .
first of all , we went to the insurance agencies , and they actually wanted to break a device that they can communicate with -- a stephen hawter machine .
in which we gave him a little push , we could actually vibrating it at the same time , and not vibrating -- something which is only available in quantum mechanics .
if you look at the history of the founding fathers , a lot of you have been interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a natural world .
the leader of congress came to stage , and said , &quot; professor romer , thank you very much for your talk , but perhaps we might watch the tedtalk .
and so far as isolation goes to us as a species , it becomes isolated and the changes of the environment , which could make evolution in natural ways .
and by the way , we go and circulate and mix and mix as much as much as they can &apos;t say , that isolation is necessary for evolution to find .
they invented , according to decoric acid , the box game , and then a national strategy , and they would play a national strategy . the next day you would play .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the functions of the old greek historian , hercular denus , you may know this story . the story about how and why games were invented .
but also being appropriate . because it turns out we &apos;re going to use all this time to play , actually , what we can do as human beings .
the incredible thing to me is that the projects i got most of the time , or where i was the biggest success , those are where i interacted with things directly .
so the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t work as well as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t work as well as a little bit that doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle .
take two programs , and they make kids through the exchange of their subroutines , and the children &apos; features are the attributes of the subroutines of the two programs .
but another thing happened , really interesting , where things were completely different , and then these cells began to communicate and share information , so that communities of cells evolved .
and i went back through the same axis of shame and self-doubt , felt me and moved to work to work until it was again and again and again .
maybe i wanted to take as successful and so able to take responsibility that i was so mad and so that i would be able to deal with my patients .
how about the hunter-gatherors where you are , giving a voice to try and make change , for the very first time ?
if i think of creating abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life full of luxury for anyone on the planet ; it &apos;s about making a life full of possibilities .
in the next book , we &apos;re going to have a interaction where you use the video of the ipads and through augmented reality an animation that appears to appear on a plant .
if we don &apos;t do that , if we &apos;re going to do something like that , we &apos;ve got to be guilty about that we don &apos;t want to be guilty , high-tech colonialism .
so one organism could be learning , for example , a certain fruit , because they tasted bad , and it made him sick , the last time he had dinner .
and it turns out that when you do it , something feels different , it &apos;s a very good tool to get people to save .
there &apos;s never been the history of the engineering development in the history of engineering , this sort of recurval growth , which is the scale order all the few years .
the interesting thing here is that this slide , like this slide , are like this , which we often meet in our field , a kind of on a semi-cutter curve .

the reason why kids with this kind of body -- whether it grew up or sisiese twins had twins twins , it &apos;s a static -- of surgeons often being involved in the norm , because it would be vital for their physical health .

it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , and sometimes not , but the idea that we should not allow science to do their work , because we fear fear is really a dead end , and it holds millions of people from farats .
and because i was born without no legs , and my feet turned out to them , and i just had a few toes on this one and a few toes on the other foot , he was the overdated , that strangers had to lead the bad news .

if we &apos;re in a game world , i think a lot of us can transform ourselves in our best version , anytime , and immediately be well-willing to solve the problem , as long as we need to take it again .
but , as we think the only way to make biology is a huge impact with the cost of the cost of food or demand from their availability , and therefore we &apos;re working on cells that we &apos;re working on , and we &apos;re working on cells that we &apos;re working on .
so we feel so guilty about the earth that we say , there is no bio-tube building , not a clever and , no natural panic , and how you all fall to go back to our own quircies .
we look in this pattern , and we look at the 50 hertz , and when there &apos;s nine , it &apos;s going to be a little bit of fun , and then it &apos;s going to be a little bit more candy , and then we &apos;ll get back up .
and what i think is that the interactive media works in us by archaaniic , cognitive models , so we have a mapping that &apos;s been programmed in our biological memory very , very long , and that we can use it through interactive media .
and i &apos;m just one of these little devices , because the things should be more intuitive , always become more important , ever-becoming more natural , and there &apos;s one need to look at what is the rest of us , what is the use of junk or intuitively .
and then , when i move further to this natural user , where i &apos;m going to take you through voice , by language , by gesture , by gesture , by gesture , by gesture , by gesture , by gesture , and curting things , i &apos;m even more quickly and left .
but it would be worse when i didn &apos;t remember that i was thinking about that over 20 years ago , when i was a teenager , i wanted to be a writer with the same kind of anxiety response .
and then i went down to six , and then we &apos;ve gone together with friends , i &apos;ve become co-founder of the company on the first of the world , who became one of the largest neurons of the world .
what you have to do is seem to be easy , but it &apos;s not . you have to do all of the co2 coming out of the spid , under pressure corks and then forth and hoping that there &apos;s still there .
as a result , he &apos;s particularly susceptible to these schizophrenic periods , which is sometimes as bad , and he &apos;s walking away , and he &apos;s walking away in the streets of skid row around that horror and rapeling of his own mind .
and as a miracle , he took his violin , and he started playing by hearing a couple snippets of violin concerts and asked me to play them .
what if we could turn that situation and turn the internet on its head so that we instead of going through one another to the other , and we can see that instead of going through one another , you can go from a lot of things , and see patterns which otherwise have hidden planes ?
now , to decide a glass to buy a glass is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our brave -- but it turns out that the process of heating problems also affect us .
now i have to confess , if i was a college student , i thought , okay , sex / death , death / death , death of sex -- it seemed kind of reasonable at that point , but with every year , it &apos;s been a chance of increasing doubt .
the great geneticist in the 20th century , steven dodobsky sky , who was also a communist firm in the russian orthodox church , once wrote an essay in the russian orthodox church , a paper called &quot; nothing in biology . &quot;
and even better , the things that you and i &apos;ve spent several thousand dollars -- gps , hd video and photograph , libraries of books and music , libraries of books and music , are now stunzed and cheaper in their cell phone .
in this -- what i did is -- what i did is i &apos;ve taken this code -- the code is made of normal letters that we use for symbolic -- and i wrote my business card on a piece of dna , and i &apos;ve spent it 10 ^ 22 times .
so what happens in &quot; the fort balance , &quot; is that everything from the top to the very end , completely with brands to the very end , completely with brands to the very end , completely with brands that you &apos;re going to see in the movie , that &apos;s a brand .
we took a cat camera , and we built them apart , they put on a led light , and now we have a device that &apos;s available to us -- you can build it yourself , we can build the code for free .
so we started with a bunch of volunteers that we did , a little more than a year , helped the things that we took away -- different kinds of things that they would throw away -- things that would throw them away .
now , if you take this picture -- i was originally italian , and every boy in italy grows with this picture in his room , but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is that in the formula one in the past decade .
i &apos;m happy to say that we don &apos;t have these modes -- a surgeon i spoke to a few years ago , who had brought a few siamese twins who had brought up to them , partly to make himself a name .
now the amazing thing is that the tataomy , which are in the ligs , are the mao-pants pair of exactly the same kind of thing that is necessary to power the trypine crown . ask yourself .
in love , i fell in love with evolution , and i was doing something very basic : in most of the existence of life in individual organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information of the cell will continue to grow in either larger cells .
you know , it &apos;s not only that people need to eat dog food if they go in retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to recover , it also means that they have a lot of investment in their businesses .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents to say that you never would be going to walk , and never be a permanent life as other children or that you would never lead me to become a permanent life since ever since . &quot;
and this is what we need to see on millions of faces all over the world , if we take the barriers to attack the next century , the face of the next century , the face of which are going on at the brink of an epan triumver .
and it turns out , under income dollars a year , for americans , and that &apos;s a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative sample , under one income of 30,000 dollars a year .
the moment that i turn my hand from you , so that you see it from the back , that finger here , the top here , is just hanging off there where he was so intense .
so there &apos;s great propchallenges here . there are challenges in transmission , and if we say that the source of energy is beyond the country , you don &apos;t just need the technology , you also need to deal with the risk that the energy from where different comes from .
it also has three major problems , the cost , especially in central countries , are high , and the question of security is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human work , that the fuel is not used for weapons .
if we change the plastics so that it can go into biological systems , if we &apos;re changing the water memory , you can go back to a baby in israel , or in tunisia , in tunisia , in tunisia , in tunisia .
and they &apos;re going to get healthier by using the miaconic healthier , and they &apos;re going to get trained through the academy academy , and by getting the opportunity to use 3d computing and flight computing , and so much more productive than ever before .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as an tyranzei reminder , and you can think of yourself as one that kind of the living self is going through experience through experiences that don &apos;t need the living self .
so i also wrote an article about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this was &quot; frankenfood , &quot; why they believed that the molecules thought this was &quot; frankenfood , &quot; they believed that the molecules were a random kind of overhaul on the area of nature .
tan , anonymous for football , was now tan , refugee and social activist , who was invited to the places of places that they had never heard of , and in homes that their existence would never have imagined .
in which we did this simple thing , there was an increase of participation over 20 percent , and there was a number of people in the number of people who were willing to pay or increase an increase by four percent that they were willing to pay on the savings account .
i mean , if i &apos;m in the elevator alone , i do all this kind of weird stuff , but then other people come along , and i &apos;m listening to all these things , because i don &apos;t want to do it , or frankly , they &apos;re rocking .
and i asked myself to place and move to his brother and father -- in the words , &quot; well , my proposal is like , &quot; well , my proposal is like this : tony &apos;s going to talk , we &apos;re going to get a machine and we &apos;ll find a way to do it again .
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should be able to support rights in terms of people , because i have to admit i ever know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know
if you allow anyone to activate your own internal forces -- the human mind is so pathetic -- if you can do it , and for somebody in a crucial moment , you &apos;re a very good teacher .
we talked about this issue , and , you know what ? most of his life was tom , the embodiment of the dreeltional modern artist who was trying to do that runaway creative taste that lived in his own .
and then , under the course of that , there are things that have been completely used everyday in life , which most people aren &apos;t aware of , for example , crawn enzymes that allow us to wash with 40 degrees clocks .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 villages in the world , with students , developers and architects , even with ctos &apos;s fortune , and there &apos;s something about this task , which is deeply creative in the nature of collaboration , and i want to share some of those with you .
and then the next one that we came up with now with &quot; three-dimensional neural model , or the mental models of the software , have worked , which is that you have an idea of what the metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop to make the computer .
and there you can see that you have a our seven senses , most of whom we think we &apos;ve only got five , now , is now about seven of them , and as an extension of growing again .
and that was a big shell back then because of course , the living language began to manifest in the form of writing , which means what &apos;s going on and alive , i &apos;m going to talk and take it in stone , so i &apos;m going to do it .
i &apos;ve graduated , and i &apos;m hoping that the video works , a very , very beautiful project brought up , which is the mask &apos;s work work by michael burk , and jor&apos;s &apos;s freitz , and jan-moruz floures .
and yes , so you can see it &apos;s relatively generic , so there &apos;s some people who do it at home alone until to large , so large , bigger organizations that are more divided to it .
and they &apos;re also called the general doctor , so he can recognize where my shareration issue is , and it &apos;s not only the moment i need cardiological support or so i need a look into the past .
well , what &apos;s being able to do this thing is that it &apos;s starting to start the value of sensors -- -- like , printing sensors and vibrating sensors -- and it &apos;s enabling the code that are still linked to the wrong deal with the wrong data data .
that &apos;s the problem : transparency , free of deception and towels , just to discover and look at it , and look at it , imcharacterized by vision , and that access to information , especially , business skills -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
and dr. kean ran on , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned kids , if they don &apos;t say anything different , and when they get a little bit of support , then kids can achieve a lot of them , and then kids can achieve a lot . &quot;
what if you could change the sperm and cell cells or the fresh plastic to change your kids a better chance for a better life -- eliminating the diabetes , eliminating the risk of cancer , the risk of cancer , are reducing the risk of cancer ?
i find that they were so tag and strong , and so radical , and so radical in what they were doing for all the few years , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely forgotten .
and , again , if i pull out one step and look at everything , i can rearrange my course , maybe , after my search past -- here , i looked for &quot; nenetii .
it &apos;s turning up to the herbivores to the herbivores of monocultures , chemicals in the earth , the fish of fish , the fish , and all the time has been asked , &quot; if we feed more people cheaper , how awful can it be ? &quot;
and the main reason for this is that we might enjoy it , and we might enjoy these vast titudes full of mayonas , mustard , vinegar , and we don &apos;t actually have the compares and the marginalized and then actually can vote out of the amazing supply .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in engineering and design , and working in an environment that is pretty much about what you really hate , we managed to do it in the government .
and i think there are theories that we can understand that really started to understand how everything works with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a string of narrative about which different types of these kinds of prescriptions were encoded for chemicals .
these curiosity also said that whenever i wasn &apos;t in school , i was always going to school through the forests , wandering and forth , frogs and snakes and the incidents and the incidents and the incidents and the incidents and the incidents and the incidents and the incidents and the incidents and the incidents and the incidents and the incidents and the incidents and the incidents and the incidents and the incidents and the incidents and the incidents and the incidents and the incidents and the ponds and the ponds and the ponds .
you can think of this cultural habitat system as a colletator , potentially , as the total sum of all thoughts and dreams , that were generated by the human imagination since the beginnings of consciousness , defined by the beginnings of consciousness , defined .
and this is very amazing , because you actually believe that these distributed technology that you &apos;ve encountered was actually going to take you in the future , but actually it &apos;s the case that the future is right at us , with our archaan roots .
and this sound and the rhythm have the geology , the topography of a region , which , of course , allows you to add these songs and make it in a left , and then move back to the left , to the right and again .
how can these people find from an flora of 80,000 species , these two super-cidal plants that are combined , and that &apos;s the whole kind of biochemical version , so that the whole one will create a form of biochemical version so that the whole one is bigger than the sum of its parts ?
so she goes to the house , and she searches for the paper and the poem is going through her , and she picks up a pen as it goes through it and then she got a pen -- and then she said -- was it like it was like her other hand kissing it and going to do it .
so when i do that , that &apos;s what i do at the scene of the crime , and then they &apos;re going to go , and then they turn that method , and then they turn that method , and then you can say , whoa , this hair belongs to this guy , like this .
a continent is still going on , because thought was that sub-saharan africa doesn &apos;t make a religious belief , of course , and of course there was one and a capitalism is simply the subtnant of this very low religious thought that &apos;s been broadcast during the tragic state of the pathogen .
later the day , i went around this site with miguel , and i asked him , i said , &quot; well , for a place that seems to be so naturally , &quot; unlike any farm i &apos;ve ever had , &quot; how do you sound success ? &quot;
and then , when i add a halb and then you &apos;ll see it &apos;s not only one entity , which is circle , circle and circle , and we see an organization , we don &apos;t see three pieces anymore , a circle , a circle , another circle , another circle .
so , imagination is more brbrely , and with that sentence , i also want to conclude , and give you a hint , including designers need to think differently to come in new solutions , and in that particular , i thank you very much for your attention and please .
by playing music and talked about music , this sort of craged man who had just moved through the streets of los angeles , an adorable , educated , educated , well-trained musicians .
about an hour after they got home , after i sent them home , she would knit and the family called 911 . the lifeschool brought them back to the emergency room with a heart of 50 , which is a dangerous shock effect .
well , what you could do with the patient , and we &apos;ve actually done clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been made , and it &apos;s made , and it &apos;s done , and it &apos;s done , and it &apos;s done , and it works , and it works , and it works , and it works , and it works , and it works , and it works , and it works , you could actually shake the internal reflection of the patient &apos;s visible .
if you give me one wish for me , for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love that wish , or i could choose that wish , which is that , to take halce energy .
what i do instead , and whatever the designers of thinking machines do is we think of a certain abstract level , uniating the machine , and the machine makes something to do a far way , better and faster than we could do it .
and the idea is , again , imagine that again , we put people together to do something , and to change the environment -- almost like something we call it , cloud motion , as you move into an outbreak , but with a cloud .
we worked with robert to boll , one of the best balth dancer of our time -- the √©tole at the metropolitan theater in new york and the scala in milan -- we recorded his movements in 3d to use it as a momentum for the following fire .
on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are there , which are the thermhihil , and they survive , if fish would be there , if fish would be there , if fish would be there , it would have a habiting fish for themselves .
we believe that poingmik -- we think that poingmik is not persuasive , but we believe that storytelling can change the world and so we &apos;re probably the most central institution for storytelling in the world . our website will be 35 million indians every month .
she ran like the devil on her house as she was tracked by this poem , and it was just about that she had to catch fast enough to a piece of paper and a pen so she could pull it through and pin on on the jar .
so not only one farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not only one farm that measures its success to their health , rather than a farm that is literally replacing a water napkin , and not only for those fish , but for you and me .
so , this whole discussion , what &apos;s going to go away and move , energy change , like this , on the island , we have to take for example in the island for example 20 to 30 percent by 30 to 30 percent , so we make the wind and the sun .
you know , as a translator as a translator as a translator , you don &apos;t divide the text into another language , but the deeper meaning of the words and the word of words , so everybody who has a sense of doing it with foreign language .
so if you look at google , you know , it &apos;s a concept of what the virtual world can combine with the real world with the real world , which is called our microbial nature to the physical world , is defined again .
the older black man stood up . he saw the deputy , and he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m moved to tell this young man , you &apos;re going to lose the goal . don &apos;t give up . &quot;
i think it &apos;s perhaps a bit about taking clear to you that we don &apos;t necessarily have to end up , but that we &apos;re wired to give them a hug , to put it on the hm , and perhaps to dance with it .
it &apos;s not by the latest regrets of music and traveary innovations , not by pumps , but by fresh water , not by the grocery bones , not by the fish boats and the nets , not from the fish boats and the nets , not from the fish boats and the nets , not by fishing boats .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that the problem of decision-making uses fuel -- is -- are they going to move the excess alternatives ; environment -- so we can deal with more categories , fewer options , on complexity .
zones of prescriptions are things that are playful , fresh like the fresh bell , timeline , adventure , adventure and sweet , magenta , tencally , tencally and mystical , tencally , soucally and mystical , and mystical , as gerone .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature is not a line between male and female , or by male and as a female and a female and a female and a female , we feel it , which is the dividing line of course .
so , what does that mean when we look at what happens in evolution , and how we think about the place thinking about people in evolution , and particularly how we look into the next stage , i would say that there are a series of possibilities .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to discover the possibility of being able to be what we are : people with full consciousness , who have to be aware that all humans and gardens have to be wealth in space . and there are great moments of optimism .
and maybe a little way of looking at what might happen in a couple of decades , if you have cyborg body to explore something or do other things , in all sorts of quantitative languages that i can think of as a science record .
finally , a consequence of buying a poorly sitting jeans when there is just a way to buy a kind of cake , if you &apos;re unsatisfied , and you ask why , who &apos;s responsible , and the world is responsible . what would you have ?
and have wind and sun and the burden , and came to the conclusion , a very exciting outcome , that you need to go through the conventional system that takes in 20 years per kilo-hour hour , it takes about 50 cents a pound hour , about four cents a kilo of a kilowatt-hour , it takes about 50 cents a kilo-40 cents to get it in a six-hour hour , about four cents a kilo of a kilowatt-hour , it takes about 50 cents a kilo-40 cents to get it in a six-hour hour , about four cents a kilo of a kilowatt-hour , it takes about 50 cents a pound hour , about four cents a kilo of a kilowatt-hour , it takes about 50 cents a kilo-40 cents to get it in a six-hour hour , about four cents a pound hour , it takes about 50 cents a pound hour , about four cents a kilo of a kilowatt-hour , it takes about 50 cents a pound hour , about four cents a kilo
and so , in front of the background , i set up natural user interface , which is the next generation for human computers in the relationship of the human computer in the relationship that our tools , or how the computer &apos;s computer is changing .
the first project that we &apos;ve done as an international group , when we were essentially aware of ourselves , we &apos;re now aware of ourselves as a real scene , and we &apos;re online , and we know so people who are always waiting and so forth .
these are actually a more artistic core , so there are a lot of artists and philosophers and in partnership with scientists to do it through these technologies , and asking them to process this , because there &apos;s a cave exhibitions and it &apos;s all sorts of things .
at that point , the patients come in . they can &apos;t only take over the control , captain on their own ship , but can help us help the challenges that are available to us , and the cost of health care , higher energy , and so on .
and if you do it for a few minutes , you &apos;ve been able to get the living self from patient a bad thing , and you &apos;ve been able to get this reminder of the self &apos;s self much better , because now you have a patient a better story about his experience .
i &apos;ve been interested in the placebo of placebo effect . it may seem strange that a magician are interested in it , because you look at it like me , when you think of it as a &quot; a deception that will become something like something . &quot;
and for the next weeks , i chose to pick up , and i first picked up the gay shame for the first time , which exists in our medical culture -- i felt myself , isolated , not the kind of healthy shame that you feel , because you cannot talk with the colleagues .
how often did we have selected a political leaders -- and sometimes we have a lot of energy to choose a new political leaders -- and then we refuse to go back and we expect the government to express our values , and then we don &apos;t change much ?
so what you got was this : your name here : my tedtalk you don &apos;t know what the subject is going to be , which will ever let you be able to pass the ears , especially if i could give your company on their involvement .
in fact , i &apos;ve done the most part of my career that seems to be the appalling part of my career , and all of this is just for trying to study social repertoire that makes you compelling and interesting , and hopefully hopefully what they &apos;re doing for the audience and accessible to the audience .
and one day he told me at one of my practice -- these practices were just tihohohok and grace -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful and young girl , you &apos;re going to tear up one day .

the neolithic revolution , which brought us to agriculture , and we put ourselves in this moment of the seed river , the poetry of the profer , the poetry of the propel of the priescus and a hierarchy , specialization -- only 10,000 years ago .
with total transparency , which is the new thinking , which is what the new thinking thinks is , say , don &apos;t you say in cragtale of flesh and no beef , i just want to hear this , and just want to do that .
i don &apos;t know if this is smart , if you want to look at the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now an discourse in geoengineering about whether you should be available , or that innovation needs longer to take this innovation longer than we expect .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about this for a long time , but you could never quantify it , whether it would work , but since ever , there &apos;s been some materials ever , you can simulate it , and see that , yes .
they combine the oily co2 , which leads to the temperature , and that will have some very negative rate , effects on the weather and perhaps worse , which correlation to the weather , and perhaps worse , the indirect line of natural ecosystems are going to be such a flourishing change .
you &apos;re doing it in order to be the challenge of the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment that there is . you &apos;re in the process of space , and because of the weird connection , when a small group of people form a team .
i took them with them and screeped them to the world there : astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in such extreme situations , and i took them to look around the sources , and so on .
here you have this delefing between the unconscious and the conscious , which jumps immediately without it , without allowing you to do something about it , and the things that you know is very different , so that you can do much better for you and other other things .
but if you &apos;re going to buy a new color printer in 2011 , the leading laser printer , and print a site , then this side bright yellow blob on every side that the site is clearly clear to you , in a pattern that is clearly clear to you and your printer .
now , they may have a moderatory contribution , and if you make better money than i expect , that would be great , but my core message is that we have to do five of these five work , and we can &apos;t give any of them because they all have significant problems .
in some of the following expeditions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in thermal sources , and sometimes things that i had never seen before , sometimes do things that no one had ever seen before , and the science at the moment when we saw it .
i &apos;m going to show you a study that i &apos;m going to tell you about gur huberman , and i cut me kamenica , and i did the decisions to savings plans for almost a million americans in the entire united states .
in hong duras , the leaders of the government would depend on the aid of partners , they could benefit from their partner countries that they would benefit from their partner to be able to benefit from the laws that they do in the law .
and so the tedtalk , in a very simple form , is that a charter city is a place , whose beginning is a place where it is culturally mature land , a founding contract that decides the law , and the opportunity to decide , either under those rules or not .
another example : a couple of years ago , i received the call of a 19 year-old man who was a boy , who was a boy , had sex with his girlfriend , lived as a man , and he just figured out that he had parkinson &apos;s glasses and a vanilla one .
in our desire to protect people in our heart , we want to tell them the cold , hard truth about their medical care , or even a projection for the quality of the quality of life that they expect , we need to watch that they &apos;re not going to be disabled .
and then there &apos;s a reminder of self , and remember self itself is , and keeping the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that comes to the doctor by saying , &quot; how did you feel ? &quot;
and now you could talk about why that is a deception , why you don &apos;t know that there are only three fingers down here : because the mind and the way that he explores information is not one of them , one , two , three , but she sees it as a group .
and i know that some of you are saying , &quot; it &apos;s not better ? &quot; would the world not be a better place if we all talk about a language ? &apos; let &apos;s be the audio .
we came back with the genetic eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural death , and when we asked people about a little bit of a natural death , they gave them that one of the people was so old that he died and we killed him with the spear .
he was talking to a very , very expensive and social note on yo-yo ma and hillary clinton and about how the dodgers never put it into the baseball series , and all of this is because of the passage of the first violin in the last sentence of beethoven &apos;s fourth violin .
because we have this self-deception , this feeling , of being great by the highest character , not by one of those of these kinds of cases , not by one of these kinds of cases , as a organism that exists , that &apos;s something that exists for us .
and then the renaissance came and all changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual to the center of the universe -- all of all the gods and mysteries , and there is no space for mystical creatures to pay orders from the divine constitutics .
this strange event was that i wrote a book recently -- a biography called the tem , thorium , love -- that decided to be different from all my previous books for any reason in the world and became a large square event , international headquarters .
but if we look at these metabolic map , which is very simple , compared to ours . trust me , that &apos;s easy , but if we look at all of these genes that we can eliminate one after the other , it would lead to a living cell .
and there was a time in which there was only jeans of a kind , and they bought it , and they were terrified , and they were terrified , and they were terrified , and they would have enough disease , and they would have enough disease , they started to feel &quot; okay . &quot;
well , the problem -- the problem is , even those of us who have the sympathy for the difficult condition , they are as orginiically and colorful , but sort of to look at the past as the real world , meaning it .
but i remember the lights in the oil coast on the central coast of coast , and on the young man who came along and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and on the flavor of the first stone rock , one of the men gave me one of the men on the platform .
they knew that every year about 75,000 people had left their country every year to migrate to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to ensure that these people can stay in their country and do exactly the same in hong as .
we have this plan plan , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought of all the people i wanted to make a hand and didn &apos;t do all the things that i was trying to do .
this is what it looks like to look after a date , but what he really seeks is somebody who winzes him when he is for a foot of snow , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at all when he comes from a foot of snow .
i wanted to go back to routine and the comfort of the life of a fortune -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters who kind of looked at each of their day until 20 years by telling each other , by telling each other to the stories of their day and fall , three still still in the same bed .

he went at high speeds when he suddenly heard a little bit of a melody , which is very often difficult for him , and he wants to have them . she &apos;s gorgeous . he can &apos;t believe it .
so where the founding fathers have become extremely common to figure out how individuals could be protected by the state , it &apos;s possible that if we put more mothers into this concept , we can take more of a concept , not just how to do it .
we don &apos;t have the situation of how it &apos;s in iran &apos;s iran , where a man who feels like being sexually to other men , is punished by death , if he is willing to be a leader , in which case he can stay alive .
this is actually nice at this , which is , you know , agriculture generates a biogas , based on a hectare of land with five thousand people in favelas , can be a farmer around a thousand,000-hundred dollars , and it &apos;s waiting to grow birds and burn and clean and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fishes .
but the process and the heavy contrast that surrounds him is all the time he &apos;s made out of the genius where he had nothing to come . he realized that there was no prestructioned thing to do .
the reason for that is , if i would draw it on a normal curve , where , say , this is the years , the timeline of a kind , and this is a fraction of the way that i want to show you a graph , then the graph is fine .
well , not exactly what i hoped i was hoping , but i went -- the stairs up , the hallway , the hallway , the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; &quot; the firemen that were going on at that point , to get a pair of shoes .
i read this list to a friend , and i had to laugh at all , but i was just as ridiculous , but i was just going to talk to &quot; and couldn &apos;t talk to me , and i didn &apos;t have to speak , and i had to go to the same level of plastic and the mesh of the network .
these older people are now coming to me and say , &quot; mr , stevenson , they talk , they &apos;re talking about saying that we should stop saying to you that we should have to stop saying to you that we should have to stop the first time in our nation &apos;s history .
now in the world of the savings , i think one of the best examples that came on recently to the market was something that david laibm wrote was a very strong program , which is something that david latzson has been having very much , it &apos;s a program that is offered at harvard .
you know , when michelangelo shaped the moses , it says he took out the hammer and put him on moses -- in fact you can still see a little bit of it -- and he said , &quot; perel√© , don &apos;t you ? why are you not ? &quot;
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the idea of wealth , with which you get new elements into the game -- the testicles -- and also how the game is capable of making it as well as it does as well .
i &apos;d been trying home in my lab , a little bit further , and then i bought some extra lights on ebay , and then i bought this extra piece of light on ebay , and i took a little bit of the next time home .
i had to change all of these kinds of ways with these thick , elastic bases -- in different colors -- you know , to build my leg muscles , and i promised these bonds more than anything else . i hated them . i picked them off . i picked them . i picked them . i picked them . i picked them . i picked them . i picked them . i picked them . i picked them . i picked them . i picked them . i picked them . i picked them .
this is when you focus a laser bar , in a room , you can break little particles in the air , or in the liquid , and then move in that focus , and then you move in that focus , and then , like this kind of opening board .
bill gates : to get the simulation on a supercomputer , all the major scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we just need a few 10 million . and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure we &apos;ve tested it in the hundreds of thousands of millions .
there &apos;s a few pilot projects that can produce on a 60 percent -- 80 percent , but it &apos;s going to get a hundred percent , and a dicfication of the co2 is very difficult , and a dicfication of the co2 is a big challenge .
and our goal was , we wanted to go back to seventdy and nine percent renewable , and then there &apos;s this rest , the last rest , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable , which is going to be very , very expensive , and it won &apos;t work that you do it from batteries .
this really works , in the academic reformation , and we thought , well , we &apos;re going to get , we might have a webcam , we might have a webcam that &apos;s cut up the lens , and then we took a microscope that &apos;s subtrated about four hundred times .
in my eight years of medical consciousness and journalism , i have a personal medical study study about medical mistakes and wrong treatment to make me feel for one of my first article , which i wrote for the toronto star of the toronto star . &quot;
look at this amazing demo : aliens , neutrinological acota in a trancete , which is an amazing representation of the spirit of the mind the body makes the body to express the body so that it holds out when it &apos;s being directed in the extremes of the extremes .
and the problem is that it &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be a kind of a problem , and how to simplify it , which is , you know , how to simplify any problem , and how do you do it differently , and how do you do it differently , and how to do that .
and where you see what we really wanted to do and could , and how sad we are that we are at all , and how sad we are that we are at all on earth , and how sad we are that we are at all the earth , right ?
it would be great if we could have this paradigm of normality against another possibility or the strength to articulate it even a little bit , and so we can release the forces of very many children , and invite them to bring their very special and valuable skill into society .
in this picture , i put a bush as a center of all directions , because if you look at the fringal tree of life , all the species of life in these lines have been successful in evolutionary terms : they have survived ; it has to value its environment and strength .
but in fact , we see more and more and more , that if you &apos;re willing to narrow , and the less important possibilities are going , well , then there &apos;s a sales of sales , it &apos;s going to cost the cost , &amp; amp ; and there &apos;s a change in change .
whenever we think about a native and landscape , we either mean rousseau , and the old scaffolding of the onion , which is a rasitional idea , and say , these people are more with nature than we are .
the people at the back or the ones who will see the video eventually will say , &quot; well , it looks pretty impressive , but when it would be really real , it would be very impressive , but when it would be really real , it would bleed out to bleed . &quot;
now , i like a little extreme , you know , how little appetite i have on the toe of memory , but even if you make more of it , there &apos;s a real question . why do we give lentils so much weight in the edge of the weight .
it seems to be a little bit counterintuitive , so i repeat it , so that if we hunger , poverty , climate change , poverty , global conflict and obesity , i believe we must try to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week .
but there &apos;s only one company , an agency was willing to help us -- and also because i &apos;ve known john bond and richard kirsha tree for years -- i found that i had to do it alone , i had to deal with the middle man and go directly with my team .
many companies tend to be -- and this is human nature -- to avoid things where they &apos;re not secure , they become fear of those things that they &apos;re not sure they &apos;re going to be , they become fear , and they turn it into a positive , and that &apos;s a skill chegue .
but we don &apos;t even stop when we hear something like this , because we know this kind of statements for so long , so somehow we &apos;ve known the notion of so long , so somehow we have the idea that creativity and suffering somehow leads to the middle .
and then from the do-it-yourself may be self-socitive website , the founder said , &quot; well , we have to really meet ourselves , even real meet , and then we &apos;ve got two iterations , one in london , one in london , two-and-a-half times , and short after the united states , in san francisco .
i mean , most random gaze of our lives -- and i have to do this -- you know , the psychological present as about three seconds , which means , you know , there are about 600 million of them in a month . in a month , there are about 600,000 .
and what we &apos;ve done was actually to use a new kind of network that was used around the world -- this is a mobile phone web -- and using anonymous information and root information from that network that will be collected from the operators to understand how the city works .
&quot; cloud computing , &quot; which is what my friends call in autodesk , &quot; has sensors and networks , robots , 3d , robots that allow the personal production to democracy on the planet to democratize democracy , synthetic biology , vaccines and food .
they believed that a genius was that kind of magic &quot; divine character that believed that it literally lives in the walls of an artist studio -- sort of like dobby , the hausberry -- the route came and the performers were sort of invisible and the result of the work .
a group of ankara that i met a while for a while , that &apos;s a student student who wants to communicate more to the public , which is what they learn in college , and people were trying to explain what cinema is .
and the o with this premise with this premise , then , is trying to put a minim-based retts in england trying to put a minimal , and , yes , soup , and , yes , soup , and it &apos;s also how bacteria work .
but it &apos;s got 17 branding , 17 branding , who were willing to give up in those control that would play with someone to do so eight and more like me , and that ended up telling us to tell stories that we don &apos;t normally know -- stories that are never going to support a destiny .
if i show you about 600 papers , and i put them into 10 categories , or i &apos;ll show you 400 journals , and then i share them 400 journals , then you think i &apos;ve given you more choices and a better opportunity than i had given you about 400 .
so by making color , contrast and contrast on the fringals of the individual images , like flat depth , cursed color and disorders , distracting the boundaries between the various images , and then look like a single picture , even though a painting can actually contain hundreds of layers .
and that &apos;s when you have all your feelings about politics and the snake at work and all the other things that we &apos;re really excited about , is government , in the middle of tim o &apos; nonlly , &quot; what we can do in common we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
there are 175 dresss in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t count the 10 different extra olive olive , and they can use 12 balkoiicor , which you could buy to make a large number of their own lettuce .
i think a significant thing -- not the only thing , but a significant student at that explosion of the depression , and also suicide , is that people have experience the outrage because their standards are so high , and then , if you have to explain those experiences , think it would be your fault .
i had written this piece , avatar , &quot; avatar , which should have the bar of visual effects and computer-generated effects in a new ball , with realistic human , expressive characters that were made by cg , and the main figures should be cg .
my colleague at mit , assae biderman , could give you a lot more about this and the many of the other wonderful things that you can make familiar with , but i &apos;d like to talk to you in the second part that we discussed at the beginning , and that &apos;s the balance of our environment .
but we wanted to go a lot further . we wanted to build a whole bacterial chromosome . it has more than 580,000 letters of the code , and we thought we were building it in castapes from the size of the virus , which are the size of the living cell .
i probably belong , the two nice girls are there , i &apos;m probably one of the generation who has taken this bad moko warning , because i &apos;ve already started to study the machine , and i think i &apos;m going to have a doctor .
this equation has four factors . a little multiplication . you have this thing on the left -- co2 , that you want to make zero , and that &apos;s going to depend on the number of people , the average energy for every country , the average energy for every country , the average energy for every service and the co2 that will be avoided .
you know ? i think to allow you to have a naked person , he &apos;s thinking he or she is like the vessel and the essence and the essence and the source of all divine , more creative , infinite mystery is a little bit too much to get them to a test , human mind .
and it was really , very subtle , and then you get into the course of the course , just like that , in a way that i asked myself for 10 years , i had a thousand clid , where i asked myself , for 10 years , i think that was really the great thing to be .
this was the real form of an d√©ton , vu , which i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i go to a corner , i used to know what was going on in the light of the vehicle , because i went to the film .
we are at the verge of amazing , amazing events in many areas , and yet i really think that we have to go back to the enlightenment to find a time where we &apos;ve had progress , where we &apos;ve had progress , where we &apos;ve been having progress .
and if you &apos;re going to go to another vacation , there is a conflict between both of the self and you have to think about how they choose that conflict and that is really not obvious , because if you think of time , you might get a answer . and if you think of memory , you could get a answer .
if you &apos;ve ever had the chance to work in your inner-city center , like our fellow scott vacer as part of the program -- in fact , they do that -- are you all -- you &apos;ll see that the people who have the government of many different problems , including , including that one single one of the world is in your house .
so , the fact is that you &apos;re not going to remember the 20th century , 300 years , it &apos;s not going to be for his wars or technological innovation , but rather than an era where we were against it and the massive destruction of the biological and the cultural diversity on earth , is either active .
what i &apos;m first going to show you , as quickly as possible , is the basic work , a new technology that we did as part of the first year ago , but it &apos;s an environment in which it can be either locally or removed with tremendous amounts of visual data .
the computer suite of instruments have held these images together and they fit the real space that all of you in the near rockia are made in the canadian rockia , and you can see here , here &apos;s the elements of stabilisi here in the canadian rockies .
interesting historic grade note : when the mods south spain opened , they brought this practice with this , which was the language that changed over centuries of comprehensive alallah , allah , alalore , the aligore that you can still listen to and listen wild .
in fact , it &apos;s actually something that makes decisions , because if you have a patient who &apos;s , say , two directly mirrors in two different surgeons and decides what to choose , that &apos;s the surgeon who &apos;s got less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon who will be selected .
so we have a situation where , as , as we keep our science , we have to admit so much that these categories that we have thought that these categories that we have thought about for financial anatomic categories , which are very easy to create permanent expansion .
and when these people came and looked at who was the best piece of prosthetic folder in the world , this was not a literary professor , not a cytech student , but it was someone from england , manchester , a woman who was in the day as an assistant at the day of the business clinic and was the best makeup of the world .
no biologist would be able to say that 50 percent or more of all species are just before extinction , because it just doesn &apos;t be true , and yet , this -- the apocalypictable , the most optimistic in the field of biodiversity -- is very much what we &apos;ve known in the cultural diversity .
while i was looking for models in the last year to do this , i &apos;ve been looking for myself in the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see if they can help improve creative risks with creativity .
and then when you get to the software that we &apos;ve just seen , it will also understand why boys are very easy to do some of our today &apos;s software very easily , or not to be useful , that i think is a lot more intuitive than the classic software .
the first one , if you &apos;re a child , is that you &apos;re taking care of what you do , right ? and then after their parents have allowed them to play more or less , the more , their curiosity will naturally follow their curiosity , the more , the more , the curiosity will naturally follow their curiosity .
this sentence from the process of widrities lives from the idea that success and happiness depend on a challenge , without being able to deal with a challenge , as if my life would be so successful , as if i could feel my life , because i could feel the types of life with a prosthetic bulb , or whatever people feel me with me .
and from a conversation this morning with dean bradu , one of the innovators of the do it , i want to share something with you -- he gave me permission to share his technology , which is called the slingshot , which is , and many of you may have heard about it . it has the size of a refrigerator in the home .
if i had a room full of colleagues and to tell them what i just told you about , i wouldn &apos;t have to reach the end of the second story before you really reject them , i wouldn &apos;t have to reach the end of the second story before you really seem to get the issue and forget the rest .
this is a reconstructing cathedral a woman who had just done the computer with flickr on flickr . give them an android dame in flickr , and they &apos;re going to get pictures of men in tedsitting and on the university site . every one of these orbers represents a picture that has been discovered as a model .
and when i &apos;m wearing this now , for example , in which i &apos;m tracking as the representations , it &apos;s going to come up to me , it &apos;s big to me , i can look up to me , and yes , transaction is , i can look at it in the details or a shopping person or so on .
we also have one of these clusters in the same size , as it says , in the hall , to actually be the full dynamic act of this network , so in the hall , it looks like this , in the back of the sun , there &apos;s the big battery that we can simulate the net .
i was afraid not to be mine , but i was scared that i could lose him , that he could drop into one of his communities , and that i could destroy his relation to the violin if i started talking about scale and arpegios and other exciting forms of diy .
if i want to do one thing today , it is that the sum of the data we consume is larger than the sum of your parts , and instead of information access , i would like you to think about how we use information that we can use to think about how we use information that is like that , and we see trends that otherwise would not be visible .
but my dream here is that if you can do it economically , and at the same time , the skeptics will also say , &quot; okay , it &apos;s not going to shrink any co2 , i wish , because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
now , i &apos;d like to start with one example of someone who was asking a question and asking a story , and &#91; unclear &#93; he said he heard a symphony , and it was absolutely glorious music , and it was absolutely glorious music , and it was absolutely glorious music , and at the end of the shot .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering came to francis arnold &apos;s dragon to francis arnold and wilan-steca , two scientists that developed independently of each other , the natural process of evolution , encourage the natural process of the evolution of evolution .
so in a study i did with shlomo benartzi and alessandro roosevelt , i made a study with people at ring -- staff , who worked for suits -- employees who worked for suits -- -- and these people were all in a gathering they set their participation for their pension plan .
japanese parks would come back to montvel , where they had two of their oldest friends adored these older women , named whom they had two of their oldest friends , named william carr , who had organized the montome bus , and virginia tor , a white white woman -- and virginia tor , a white white woman -- and virginia tor , a white white woman -- and virginia tor , a white white woman -- and virginia tor , a white white woman , dr. king bandbandon .
these people have come online to wealth , but they &apos;ve been doing it illegal by using mosses from our bank accounts , as we do our online banking data , as we do our online banking business , as we do our online banking business , or keyloggers , which collected our credit card information .
you know , one of the great challenges to travel and one of the ilits of the ethist research is to live with people who are still able to remember the old days , and their past still feels the same , and their past &apos;s still going on in the wind .
this idea saved me when i was in the middle of the backship process , ranaturing , love , and i fell in one of those drement of the rock that we all fall when we were working on something and not work . you start to think that it &apos;s going to be a disaster . this is going to be the worst book ever written .
now , if you want to win a race , actually , if you want to win a race , something that the car works in real real time , have a few thousand sensors that are taking information from the car , that information to the system , and then use things in real time in real time terms of information .
you all know the healthy shame , if you give a mystery to the best friend , even though that one gives you sltly , and then you get caught and the best friend you have with a meeting and then a terrible discussion when you &apos;re at the end of the day , you &apos;re calling you the bad conscience and you &apos;d like you to do a mistake again .
i encourage you of reading sted-book , or looking at the movie , so you can &apos;t just understand the wonderful connectedness that happened between those two men , but also how the music was allowed to create , and how the music was allowed to create , and how it was meant to get the instrument , if this pun is allowed to get the rest of the day , and how it was meant to get the instrument , if this pun is allowed to get the rest of the day , and how it was meant to get the instrument , if this pun is allowed to get the rest of the day , and how it was meant to get the instrument , if this pun is allowed to get the rest of the day , and how it was allowed to get the instrument , and how it was meant to get the instrument , and how it was allowed to get the instrument , and how it was meant to get the instrument , and how it was meant to get the instrument , if this word is allowed to get the
and that made me another human than my friends under the kkkitl , who believe that these forests of the tree of hukuk and the boatbalo spirit are that they are in the middle of the world , who are in the middle of the world , ghoders that live in the world .
and so i ended up with the people who were interested in space , and to do that with nasa and to the nasa agency and the right space missions , and they go to the middle of the mission , and then we go to the international space system and then take our 3d camera systems .
and that was , of course , a simple trick of dr. p. , so that i was doing the exercise that i didn &apos;t want to do with the suggestion that the richest five-year-old girl in the clinic had in the second level , and it actually made me see a new and very promising experience .
in fact , some happy people and companies , sticks and crocodiles , had the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure that chris anderson will never let that happen -- the name of the talk was to buy a lot of fuss about the subject that you just &apos;re seeing .
bruce brown , a well-known design scientist at the brighy university , has gone so far to say that these mass media , he says the book and the picture , so don &apos;t name television , the internet , the internet , so on and so on , not television and the internet .
bg : well , we haven &apos;t determined ourselves in a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting legal rules for everything that is in the name , and there are great interest and the people of the company in russia , india , china -- i was here , and i &apos;ve been talking about how this fits to the energy agenda .
human ability adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people are asking me to tell me how to go around with steven travel and i always feel very uncomfortable with the questions that i &apos;m going to understand , and i &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable about the questions that i understand , why .
in the early 40s , i got a really amazing job when my professor at harvard asked me whether i was interested in walking out to haiti and to infiltrate the secret societies that were the foundation of dutiman and sound and the poison that had been used to do zombies .
the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy . &quot; that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a burden of responsibility for making choices of someone &apos;s decisions -- that the doctor -- somebody knows , and is not going to be ill , and is not going to be the best economy is a decision to make -- naming the patient .
and so there are different , but the nice thing about it is that a linux molecule has a million times more energy as a say , say , a coal molecule , and therefore , if you can deal with the problems and the footprint and the cost , the impacts and the costs , the impacts of the land and the other things , almost in a single league .
we cleaned up the chromosome of a microspecies . in fact , these are two of them , as humans and mice , we gave a few extra genes to do this chromosome , and it was very amazing when we gave it to a cell -- and it was very amazing when we put it into a cell -- and it was very amazing when we put it into a cell -- and it was very amazing when we put it into a cell -- and it was very amazing when we put it into a cell -- and it was very amazing when we put it into a cell -- and it was very amazing when we put it into a cell -- and it was very amazing when we put it into a cell -- and it was very amazing when we put it into a cell -- and it was very amazing when we put it into a cell -- and it was very amazing when we put it into a cell -- and it was very amazing when we put it into a cell -- and it was very amazing when we put it
i had a sneak encounter recently when i met the extraordinary american poet in ruth stone , who now is over 90 , but she told me that she was working on the fields . she said she could feel and hear how a poem was about the landscape on her .
and they have two proposed , and they said , whoa , that we do easier and cheaper , and then we &apos;ve got free source , so free hardware , electronics , that we have this device , and we &apos;ve actually brought it to the market .
if there was no one said , the steoprinon , which is a completely crushing , and i &apos;ve been doing it for 10 years , which i &apos;ve been doing hard for trying to buy my great engineering study , because all the colleagues in my father have talked to him , you took the money out of the window .
many of you will know the story , because from stevan article on it later , a book has been formed , with robert fellows , with robert lopez and jamie x-ayers , the double ab , who studied the juillik medications , the double ab , who studied the juillier conservation minister and the groundbreaking career of interest early through his kit .
and that &apos;s why the idea , now , if you have all kinds of problems in invest , in something you &apos;ve done , and that leads to investment , not necessarily what has happened -- and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be a big drama , and there &apos;s people in the rich world that are outdoors and saying , okay , that &apos;s not a big drama .
a couple of years ago , the mowing price took the scientist shinya , and he took a carblater , and by manipulation of just four genes that cell inducts cell to become a pluripotent stem cell in your body -- a cell potentially could be able to be able to get any cell in your body .
so i went home and i ate dinner with my wife , and i told her about everything , and we thought , &quot; well , wait a minute , if this technology exists , that you can use your eyes to manage things , that would be a way to control a laser , so that it &apos;s great . &quot;
i visited with a young colleagues , 6,000 miles from chchdu in west china , and only when i came to lhasa , i saw the face behind the statistics of which you hear , 6,000 sacred monuments that were killed in rubble and ashes , and 1.2 million people who were killed in the cultural revolution .
now even in the biology of biology , and i want to take this metaphor that comes out of synthetic biology , that biology is actually a combination of information , because it &apos;s more dynamic , because it &apos;s the way it is , because it &apos;s more dynamic , because it &apos;s the more dynamic , and not just incentives .
down here in the picture , you see the lab , in leadership , so that &apos;s a crappy garage with it as well as all sorts of technologies that i have had to do with the university , a group in paris that has been trained and a pretty interesting thing , and also does a very interesting thing , because i want to cut a second .
and in order to show you the scale , i &apos;ve all looked at all sorts of batteries that are made : for cars , computers , phones , springlights , for everything , and i found that all batteries that we could now produce , less than 10 minutes of total input .
